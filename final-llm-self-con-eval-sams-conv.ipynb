Evans!\\r\\nMaverick: Oh God, I haven't seen him from ages!\\r\\nMaverick: How is he doing?\\r\\nAria: He's doing great. :)\\r\\nAria: He got married, he runs a small family business, which he is very passionate about and generally he seems to be a happy and fulfilled man. :)\\r\\nAria: Oh, and he has two absolutely adorable daughters. :)\\r\\nAria: It was so nice to meet him, he's such a sweet soul.\\r\\nMaverick: I’m glad to hear that. :)\\r\\nMaverick: Time flies so fast, doesn't it?\\r\\nAria: It does. :) Recently I’ve met Cooper Roy, I'm sure you remember him, I constantly talked about him back then in high school, because I had a huge crush on him. He’s changed a lot!\\r\\nAria: I barely recognized him!\\r\\nMaverick: I remember, how you and Kylie used to gossip about him all the time. :)\\r\\nAria: Well, we were madly in love with him.\\r\\nAria: Or at least we thought so. ;)\\r\\nMaverick: I sometimes miss those times.\\r\\nMaverick: Everything seemed to be easier, better and calmer back then.\\r\\nAria: The world wasn’t as crazy as it is now.\\r\\nAria: I feel like politics got crazier, people - more radical and hostile and economics - less predictable...\\r\\nMaverick: Me too...:(   Aria has just run into Charlie Evans. He is now married, with two daughters, and a family business. She has also met Cooper Roy from high school. She used to have a crush on him, now she almost didn't recognise him. Maverick and Aria miss the old times and think the world has changed for the worse.                  5\n30       13716573                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Ray: Hey guys, I don't know if you heard but someone stole my bike yesterday so I'm going to post it on fb and would appreciate if you share! THX\\r\\nSam: shit, man, sorry to hear, I will share for sure\\r\\nLuke: when was it, Ray? I had mine stolen last month around when I parked around on the 9th street\\r\\nRay: Mine was there too :( cops said it's a common area for it to happen but I still havent lost hope :(\\r\\nScott: Did they check the security cameras around the place? Maybe Mariott people saw someone?\\r\\nRay: Apparently they don't overlook that area... \\r\\nLuke: Yeah, cops were completely useless too, I ended up going to Mariott on my own and asking people but they didn't see anything. I emailed their manager if they could look at the tapes but because of privacy issues blah blah blah it was a no go... Good luck man!\\r\\nRay: I mean those guys are pros... I had high grade lock on mine and an app alert and it didn't do shit. Now I'm out few grand and pissed off\\r\\nScott: I would be too. Did you post posters in the area? it's a busy street so maybe someone saw something\\r\\nRay: Yeah, I'm getting around to it now and I really hope that smeone was sober enough to notice anything. I mean it's a custom bike so I hope if they try to get rid of it it will rise suspicion\\r\\nLuke: I think it might ve already been turned into parts and shipped off. Even if you wanted to keep it and painted it, you could still recognize it\\r\\nRay: I know, that's why I wanna reach as many people as posible,maybe they ll get spooked and leave it somewhere\\r\\nSam: Let us know if you need someone to go dumpster diving with \\r\\nRay: Heh, thx Sam! I appreciate all help                Ray's bike was stolen from the 9th street yesterday even though it was secured. It was a custom bike so now Ray's out few grand. Ray wants to post posters in the area so they'll get scared and leave it somewhere. Luke had one stolen last month from the same area. Sam wants to help out.                  5\n40       13862359                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Andrea: hey Babes, how's it going?

Sondra will probably have only one free evening in March and more free time probably in June.                   5\n127      13829573                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Loreen: Sorry, dear Melissa, that I so abruptly disappeared from our chat yesterday. All of a sudden the connection was gone, which was as they explained to me due to a thunderstorm in the vicinity. Well, we heard it but never thought it could kill internet connection. Apparently in Mexico it can!\\r\\nLoreen: When I look at your photos now, I notice how well wrapped up you are. Icy wind on Belchen! Gives me shivers. But the views are stunning.\\r\\nMelissa: I guessed so much. No need to apologise, Loreen.\\r\\nMelissa: Any plans for a New Year's eve party?\\r\\nMelissa: We have already booked the same holiday apartment on Lake Constance we stayed in before. Peter is quite sentimental about it.\\r\\nLoreen: No, we do not really care about it.\\r\\nLoreen: A splendid idea. I remember you both liked it very much. How many times have you been in this flat yet?\\r\\nMelissa: This time it will be our third. Where will you be?\\r\\nLoreen: In Cuba, I think. But it's not sure yet where exactly. We'll have to do our bookings soon, as we'll probably have no internet there.\\r\\nMelissa: That's bad! How many weeks in Cuba?\\r\\nLoreen: 4 Long, eh?\\r\\nMelissa: Not when you're travelling around. Are you going to rent a car again?\\r\\nLoreen: No, not in Cuba. Too much hustle. They are said to have cheap and good public transport. Car rentals have rather prohibitive prices.\\r\\nMelissa: Oh is that so? I thought everything is cheap there.\\r\\nLoreen: Dunno yet. We'll see. What's the time your end?\\r\\nMelissa: 2:18 pm It must be early morning in Mexico now.\\r\\nLoreen: 8:12. We'll soon be going down for breakfast. Have a nice afternoon Melissa!\\r\\nMelissa: And you two a great day!                                                                                Loreen lost her Internet connection. Melissa and Peter have booked a holiday apartment on Lake Constance for New Year's Eve. Loreen might spend 4 weeks in Cuba. She won't rent a car. Loreen will go down for breakfast soon.                  5\n137    13862551-1

Do I know you from somewhere?\\r\\nKeith: Yes, you remember, I am Sophie's dad. Our kids were friends at school. \\r\\nMonika: Sophie from England?\\r\\nKeith: That's right, you do remember.\\r\\nMonika: I remember your Sophie punching my Paweł in the face, and me complaining to the school about it. How is she, anyway? Has she managed to stay out of prison?\\r\\nKeith: Yes, she is in Croatia now, for the holiday. She only punched him in the face because he was hitting her, by the way.\\r\\nMonika: Yes, but he was only hitting her because he liked her. But when she punched him back she broke his glasses, and you refused to pay for a new pair.\\r\\nKeith: That's right! So glad you remember us.                                             Monika's son Paweł and Keith's daughter Sophie were going to school together. Paweł used to hit Sophie, because he liked her. Sophie hit Paweł back once and broke his glasses. Keith refused to pay for Paweł's glasses. Sophie is in Croatia now for holidays.                   5\n321      13865182

That girl needs to learn some manners lol\\r\\nJess: I know! You can't just go around posting such things about your bf's family! has she completely lost her mind?\\r\\nPaige: she's always been a little... \"different\", I guess now she just doesn't care who knows though!\\r\\nJess: I mean, if my bf said my mom was an UNGRATEFUL SNOB he wouldn't be my bf for long...\\r\\nPaige: Exactly... and have you even seen her jewelry? looks like somethin I made when I was 5 :D no way I would wear that now! and Sean's mom is so classy, she's not gonna wear a macaroni necklace in public...\\r\\nJess: Right? she accepted the gift, smile and move on and don't pressure her to wear it in a family portrait lol\\r\\nPaige: well, I guess Sean is gonna be back on the market soon\\r\\nJess: You think??? I don't think she's gonna let that one sneak away so easily, you know how clingy she gets. and he's a great catch!\\r\\nPaige: ok but two more \"handmade\" pieces and she's OUT! hahahaha\\r\\nJess: yeah, but I don't think Sean can bring her home again, not for a while tho\\r\\nPaige: I hear she has an awesome condo her dad got her when she was 19... if only I were so lucky... I don't think she's ever even had a job!\\r\\nJess: wow, and she has the nerve to call someone a snob. Well, excuse me, your highness, not all of us can make papermarche junk and not worry about rent! just get a job like the rest of us!\\r\\nPaige: :D I couldn't say it better myself. well, maybe Sean is hoping to get dibs on the condo when she finally ends up in rehab...\\r\\nJess: I don't think Sean is like that. I think he genuinely is into her, who know for what reason. I mean, I guess she isn't TERRIBLE. just spoiled!!!\\r\\nPaige: yeah. promise me you gonna tell me if you ever see me turning into her! \\r\\nJess: of course, honey, that's what friends are for :)                                                                       Keira made some handmade jewelry for her boyfriend's mother. She apparently didn't like it too much. Keira publicly called her an ungrateful snob. Her boyfriend, Sean, is really into her. Jess and Paige don't really understand why.                  5\n374      13727936                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Tina: Hi love, you Ok?\\r\\nSally: Yep! Just got back from hols, had a great time, lovely weather too!\\r\\nTina: God, yes you have! Right in the middle of a heatwave, brilliant timing!\\r\\nSally: Yes, and unusual for a British summer! We had some lovely days out too.\\r\\nTina: Where'd you go?\\r\\nSally: Widemouth Bay, Sandymouth Bay, Cambourne, Bodmin Railway, Seaton Trams, PeccoRama.\\r\\nTina: Sounds like you did plenty!\\r\\nSally: Yes, we also had a few days around Bude, where there's a lovely second hand bookshops, pasties everywhere etc. Oh yes, and a rowing boat trip or two!\\r\\nTina: Oh, I love being out on the water!\\r\\nSally: We discovered we're not seafaring folk! We went on a pedalo boat first, I was too fat for it and we were front heavy, so I had to get out, nearly fell in in the process and had to crawl out on my stomach.\\r\\nTina: That must have looked funny!\\r\\nSally: Was a bit embarrassing! Next time, we tried a rowing boat, but we were hopeless at rowing! Then Mitch hit his head on the wooden seat and we had to go to the hospital as he felt so dizzy. Luckily, he didn't have concussion. Decided to give boats a miss after that.\\r\\nTina: No wonder! Still, lovely that you enjoyed it on the whole. Bye, love!\\r\\nSally: Bye! See you in the gym this week?\\r\\nTina: Hope to, I must get back to 2 or 3 times a week!\\r\\nSally: I know, me too! See you!                                    Sally came back from holiday. Summer is very warm in Britain this year. Sally visited a few different places, did a rowing boat trip and pedalo boat trip. Mitch hit his head on a wooden seat but did not have concussion.

John works with his dad.                   5\n485      13680723                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Mike: Please come over and get some of these apples, we picked way too many!\\r\\nZelda: Ooh, apples! Sure!\\r\\nMike: We went a little overboard...\\r\\nZelda: LOL! I can take some for mom as well if you want?\\r\\nMike: Please do! No idea what we were thinking!\\r\\nZelda: It was a nice day, you were in an orchard, why not keep picking?\\r\\nMike: Exactly! Now! Apple overload!\\r\\nZelda: You could always make applesauce. It freezes nicely.\\r\\nMike: Good idea. How do I do that?\\r\\nZelda: Just peel, core and cut up the apples, put in a pan with sugar and let it cook low and slow down to applesauce.\\r\\nMike: Sounds simple!\\r\\nZelda: You can add cinnamon if you wish or leave it plain.\\r\\nMike: Cool.\\r\\nZelda: Then you can use it for a sweet side dish with pork or savory by mixing it with bbq sauce.\\r\\nMike: Never thought of that!\\r\\nZelda: Have I just excluded myself from free apples? LOL!\\r\\nMike: No, not at all, but like the idea. Thanks!                                                                 Mike has picked too many apples. Zelda will come over and take some apples for herself and for mom. To keep the extra apples for later, Mike can make apple sauce. Apple sauce can be stored in the freezer. It can be served as a side dish.                  5\n544      13681947                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Essa: Hey, do you have a group for M&A?\\r\\nKuba: Nope, I didn't come to the last class\\r\\nEssa: We are 3 and you can join us.

really\\r\\nJulia: so we decided to take it easy\\r\\nJeremy: also Julia was sick for a few days so we slowed down a bit\\r\\nJulia: ahaha, I was dying actually, it was a horrible flu, so I really couldn't ride a bike\\r\\nStefano: sure, this is understandable\\r\\nStefano: will you come back to Cagliari?\\r\\nJeremy: no, I think we will take a ferry from Olbia to Tuscany and then fly from there to the UK\\r\\nStefano: I see, pity                           Jeremy, Emma and Julia are still riding their bikes. They're close to Nuoro now. Julia was sick, so they had to slow down for a few days. They're not coming back to Cagliari, which is a pity for Stefano. They'll take a ferry from Olbia to Tuscany and fly to the UK from there.                  5\n696      13611892                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Anna: I am gonna kill Tom today.\\r\\nLisa: What happened?\\r\\nAnna: Can you imagine that he hasn't changed the baby's diaper for the whole day?\\r\\nLisa: Dear lord, no.\\r\\nAnna: Yes. the smell, the view when I finally changed Stevie - priceless\\r\\nLisa: Did you say something?\\r\\nAnna: Yes, I said: Are you fucking kidding me? Are you a complete idiot?\\r\\nLisa: And...?\\r\\nAnna: He said that a little pee never hurt anybody and that I'm overreacting\\r\\nLisa: Typical. Has he ever admitted that he screwed up?\\r\\nAnna: I honestly can't remember the last time he apologized to me. And it's getting really tiring, you know.\\r\\nLisa: I know, would you like Sam to talk to him? You know I can stir him into the right direction, he could really make him think\\r\\nAnna: I don't know... He's only gonna get mad.\\r\\nLisa: At Sam?\\r\\nAnna: At me.\\r\\nLisa: Oh, I see. Maybe you should try to talk to him, but like serious for once, not just in regards to you know, some one thing he messed up, but his general attitude.\\r\\nAnna: I know I should, but I am just so tired all the time, I get mad and then I just let it go.\\r\\nLisa: What do you say we leave Stevie with your sister and go to a SPA for a day during the weekend? A nice massage and a facial? Could only do you good.\\r\\nAnna: That would be absolutely fantastic.\\r\\nLisa: I will call the Dream SPA later today. Cheer up. It will all be okay.\\r\\nAnna: I love you <3 Thanks!!                      Anna is angry as Tom hasn't changed Stevie's diaper for the whole day. Lisa thinks Anna should talk to Tom about his general attitude. Lisa and Anna want to go to a Spa for a day at the weekend. Lisa suggests leaving Stevie with Anna's sister. Lisa will call the Dream Spa today.                   5\n709      13680914                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Kate: how are you today?\\r\\nAdele: a bit better but still at home.

She will update her linkedin profile and start looking for a new one.                  5\n719      13828768                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Carol: Hello my dear, how's your summer this year? One hears about awful heat waves in Australia.\\r\\nResa: Not so bad here! Maybe slightly warmer than average but rarely above 30. Very pleasant indeed.\\r\\nResa: If you were staying with us, I image you'd be in the pool all the time.\\r\\nCarol: Sure I would. Are you?\\r\\nResa: No. You know me.\\r\\nResa: Bill saw the ENT doc today. He will have an MRI scan soon to determine if he has growths on the ear nerves.\\r\\nCarol: What?! What does it mean?\\r\\nCarol: Any suspicion of spreading????\\r\\nResa: No, the doc says these are usually benign.\\r\\nCarol: Thank goodness for that.\\r\\nResa: And slow growing, but the damage to the nerve is the issue.\\r\\nCarol: Has he got any hearing problems?\\r\\nResa: I'm frustrated because everything Bill has suffered from, I've asked him to seek medical attention and he's declined. So he's suffering now (and am I) from lack of preventive care.\\r\\nCarol: Typical male. Thomas is not different.\\r\\nCarol: Of course the partner suffers along, sometimes even more.\\r\\nResa: So true...\\r\\nResa: It's bad Carol. We cannot hold a decent conversation. He can no longer watch television.\\r\\nCarol: That really sounds awful. So sorry for you.\\r\\nCarol: And what about hearing aids? Also refused??\\r\\nCarol: But he loved television so much!\\r\\nResa: Another challenge to deal with.\\r\\nResa: Hearing aid will come once the cause of deafness is diagnosed.\\r\\nCarol: My mother in law had a pair of earplugs connected to the TV set via Bluetooth, so she could walk around her room and still hear tv.\\r\\nCarol: I mean the technology is there to grab it.\\r\\nResa: Yes, that's  a fantastic option.\\r\\nResa: We'll go that route soon I'm sure.\\r\\nCarol: You are a very brave and strong woman Theresa!\\r\\nResa: Thank you dear. I know I'm strong. And that keeps us both going.\\r\\nCarol: Lucky Bill to have you!                                                                                                                              There are heatwaves in Australia. It's over 30 degrees where Resa stays. Bill will have an MRI scan soon. He declined to look for medical help before.

Kyle sent Gail the link where he can watch the series.                  5\n763      13612084                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Jack: Hey.\\r\\nKarolina: Hi.\\r\\nJack: How's it going?\\r\\nKarolina: It could be better, actually.\\r\\nJack: I'm sorry to hear that. What's up?\\r\\nKarolina: Well, I've just started another year of college and I'm in this super cheap apartment since I've came here, but now the landlord wants to kick me out.\\r\\nJack: Why?\\r\\nKarolina: His son was working abroad, but he's coming back and needs the apartment to live.\\r\\nJack: Oh, that sucks.\\r\\nKarolina: Yeah. I have no idea what I'm gonna do. It's not easy to find places after the school year has started.\\r\\nJack: It's hard to find them before the school year starts, let alone after.\\r\\nKarolina: Tell me about it. I've been looking everywhere and there's abolutely nothing. Well, not that I can afford anyway.\\r\\nJack: Where are you going to school again?\\r\\nKarolina: Stanford.\\r\\nJack: Cool! You know what? I think I maybe I can help.\\r\\nKarolina: Are you serious?\\r\\nJack: Maybe. I still have to confirm some details, but my older sister goes to Stanford as well and she was saying that one of her roomates was going to leave and her and their other roomate were panicking about how they were going to pay the rent. Maybe it could work.\\r\\nKarolina: Oh my God, If that's a possibility I'll be forever thankful.\\r\\nJack: Let me just check with my sister. Or better yet, I'll give you her number and  you can talk to her directly. I'm sure she knows way more about this than i do.\\r\\nKarolina: Thank you, Jack, for real.\\r\\nJack: Don't mention it.  Karolina has started a new year at college. She stays in a cheap apartment, but the landlord needs the flat for his son, who comes back from another country. Karolina is worried about it. She studies in Stanford, the same place as Jack's sister, who may have a room for rent. Jack will contact them.                   5\n800      13730752

Is he going to get released soon?\\r\\nAbigail: hopefully the last one but he will stay in hospital for another 2 or 3 weeks\\r\\nJason: oh that's long... do you think it would be a good idea if i visit him?\\r\\nAbigail: maybe not right now, he is very tired\\r\\nJason: but in like a week or so?\\r\\nAbigail: of course then, he really likes you and he is really bored there so having some company makes him very happy\\r\\nJason: i can make some time in the week after this one and bring Karen with me\\r\\nAbigail: please do, you can let me know earlier and i will tell you if no one else is visiting at this time\\r\\nJason: of course i will :) do you think we can bring him a pie or something? Karen can make some\\r\\nAbigail: that's sweet of you but i don't think it's a very good idea, he will be on a special diet\\r\\nJason: ah you are probably right...\\r\\nAbigail: but you can bring him some good herbal tea :) you know he loves it                     Abigail's dad has had another surgery yesterday and will need to stay in hospital for another 2 or 3 weeks. Jason wants to visit with Karen. Abigail feels her dad would like that but in a weeks time when he is less tired. Bringing food is not a good idea but he likes herbal tea.                    5\n1002     13680728                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Jim: Hey, I've sent you an email about Christmas but please ignore it\\r\\nEva: OK. I was going to call Aga's parents this afternoon\\r\\nJim: I was going to buy the tickets but have to wait till I get a confirmation of my holidays\\r\\nEva: So you're not coming on 24th?\\r\\nJim: No, I was not going to come before Christmas. I'll come on 26th or later.\\r\\nEva: OK, I didn't know that\\r\\nJim: The kids will go before, on the 19th.\\r\\nEva: So they're flying with Aga's parents?\\r\\nJim: Yes. \\r\\nEva: And you're alone for Christmas???\\r\\nJim: I will probably see my brothers.\\r\\nEva: Why don't you go to Poland earlier?\\r\\nJim: I wish but I can't go with the kids because of my job, I could go on the 24th but they would have to pick me up in the afternoon... it's a trouble.\\r\\nJim: And I will have to work on 27th, probably. \\r\\nEva: ok, but if by any chance you can come before Christmas we can pick you up at the airport! it's not a problem\\r\\nJim: thank you... but I know everyone's busy on Chrismas Eve\\r\\nEva: Don't worry. We'll stay at home with my parents.\\r\\nJim: OK. I will know before next weekend.\\r\\nEva: Please let me know.\\r\\nJim: OK. Thank you. \\r\\nEva: Do you want me to explain anything to them?\\r\\nJim: No, we're fine now, thanks. Maybe I will ask you a favor when Iwona is here. We will probably need you to translate the details :)\\r\\nEva: OK!    Jim is going to come to Poland on the 26th of December or later. He might have to be at work on the 27th. If he travels before Christmas or on the 24th of December, Eva can pick him up from the airport. Eva does not have to explain anything to the parents. Her translation might be needed later on.                  5\n1024     13730292                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        June: And the party?\\r\\nChris: As said, insane!\\r\\nJune: Tell me more :)\\r\\nChris: Y weren't u there?\\r\\nJune: Sick :(\\r\\nChris: Sry to hear that. Well, it started with some light drinking.\\r\\nJune: Yeah, right. U and light drinking.\\r\\nChris: Fine! We drank and drank until we got stoned!\\r\\nJune: More like it!\\r\\nChris: Than Jake decided it's a good idea to jump off the roof into the pool.\\r\\nJune: Sick!\\r\\nChris: I know! But he did it! And everyone was like - that's fun!\\r\\nJune: Don't tell me someone else did it?\\r\\nChris: Well, some guys attempted it, but one fell to the floor and 2 actually made it.\\r\\nJune: Yikes! Did u call an ambulance?\\r\\nChris: Nah. Someone drove the poor bastard to the hospital.\\r\\nJune: But they must've been drunk!\\r\\nChris: Maybe.                                                                               The party was insane. June couldn't attend because he was sick. At the party they drank a lot and got stoned. Some people jumped off the roof into the pool. One person fell to the floor instead and was driven to a hospital.                  5\n1040     13819188

time\\r\\nCharlie: send us some photos!\\r\\nLuciano: did Diego accept her?\\r\\nOlenna: well he was quite jealous, I could tell he had been sulking\\r\\nOlenna: but he's calm when she is approaching him\\r\\nLuciano: I think those two won't fight, Diego is quite mature and calm so it wouldn't be a problem\\r\\nOlenna: once Rosa entered his sleeping spot and he seemed confused, not angry\\r\\nCharlie: pics please!\\r\\nOlenna: oh right\\r\\nOlenna: <file_photo>\\r\\nOlenna: <file_photo>\\r\\nCharlie: is it ragdoll? :o\\r\\nLuciano: omg!\\r\\nOlenna: <file_photo>\\r\\nOlenna: sorry gotta go!\\r\\nCharlie: ok but send more pics later on\\r\\nOlenna: sure!                                                                                                                                 Bella met Diego for the first time yesterday. She was tense. Diego was territorial. But he wasn't aggressive when Rosa entered his bed. Olenna will send Charlie more photos.                  5\n1138     13716372                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Ben: Well, did you guys see „Black Panther” at the cinema? \\r\\nJason: Yes, I thought it was really good indeed. Some people had warned me that the plot is really far-fetched, but I don’t think about it that way. What about you?\\r\\nBen: No, I’m afraid I wasn’t interested in the least. I find these action films utterly unbelievable and over the top. Give me One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest‘. I could watch that movie over and over again.\\r\\nAndre: Haven’t seen the panther, but totally agree on the Cucckoo’s Nest\\r\\nJason: I haven’t seen it, but I think it’s quite depressing, isn’t it? \\r\\nBen: But it really makes you think, you know. In the films I prefer emotions to action-packed scenes. But it’s a real classic, you should undoubtedly watch it.                                                                                 Jason had seen \"Black Panther\" and thinks it was good. Ben is not interested in action films but loves \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\". Andre likes the movie too. Jason hasn't seen it, but has heard it was depressing.                     5\n1148     13828935                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Kate: Hello Jamie, We just talked about you and Bill prompts me to ask about your accommodation in Mexico. Any bad experiences so far?\\r\\nJamie: Hi Kate, as a matter of fact no bad experiences at all but it's been only four places so far. Two small hotels (one excellent, one rather disappointing but nothing exceptionally worth noting) and two airbnb flats: both rather unclean but positive in other aspects, all within the average. Why would you be interested?\\r\\nKate: Your well-being of course! :))\\r\\nKate: We had 'bad' guests stay last night, but it should be expected since it was New Year.\\r\\nJamie: A mad party?\\r\\nKate: I was woken at 2 am, then up at 3 am to tell them to be quiet.\\r\\nJamie: Sorry to hear about such a nasty behaviour. They should have known better, at the latest when entering Ballito Estate. Hope no damage?\\r\\nKate: No damage... Just too many folk in the room.\\r\\nKate: And a missing towel.\\r\\nJamie: Did they calm down after your protesting?\\r\\nKate: They did. But maybe I shouldn't have complained at all, should I? They are our bread and butter.\\r\\nJamie: I think no partying can excuse keeping people awake at night! Not even New Year is an excuse, especially in such places as your estate.\\r\\nKate: Bill was furious at them but too lazy to get up and talk them off. I don't think I'd have tried to cope with the noise on my own though.\\r\\nJamie: Good that you are paid in advance. One of our hosts told us a story of a wild party in his rented apartment that he tried to put an end to, but the people in it got aggressive towards him. Before he was able to call the police, they were gone without paying and leaving a total mess behind them.\\r\\nKate: So I can say we were lucky. Where was it?\\r\\nJamie: Cienfuegos, Cuba. I don't think he mentioned the nationality of the troublemakers.\\r\\nKate: Enough about bad experiences. We wish you only the best ones.\\r\\nJamie: And the same to you!!                                                                                   Kate asks Jamie about his accommodation in Mexico on Bill's request. He was in 2 hotels and 2 Aribnb flats and the experience is generally positive. Kate had noisy guests last night. It was New Year. She told them off.                   5\n1204   13820463-1

on spotify\\r\\nMarcus: So I don't expect music from a radio any more\\r\\nAudrey: Hmm, I don't really listen to radio\\r\\nLucas: It's a good thing if you drive a car, or do washing etc.\\r\\nLucas: When you have to do something that doesn't require much attention or is just boring\\r\\nMarcus: exactly, and they have quite interesting podcasts in BBC WS\\r\\nAudrey: Hmm, I haven't thought about it, I mostly listen to music\\r\\nAudrey: but it's a good idea\\r\\nAudrey: The problem is that I don't have a device for it\\r\\nMarcus: oh, this is not a problem, you can listen to any radio online\\r\\nLucas: I don't have a radio either but it doesn't stop me from listening to different radio stations all the time\\r\\nAudrey: right, maybe I'll try it\\r\\nAudrey: seems so old-fashioned                                                                     Marcus listens to BBC World Service every day. He prefers listening to music on Spotify. Audrey doesn't listen to the radio and doesn't have a radio set. Lucas doesn't have it either. Marcus advises her to listen to the radio online.                  5\n1226     13717228                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Agnes: Are we throwing a baby shower for Ursula?\\r\\nJanice: Of course! What a brilliant idea :)\\r\\nAgnes: Cool :) Here are some gift inspirations, let me know what you think: <file_other>\\r\\nAgnes: <file_photo>\\r\\nJane: This first one is so sweet! OMG baby clothes are terrific!\\r\\nAlice: No offence, Agnes, but I think we should buy something more useful like a huge Pampers pack for example. I know that designer clothes are good quality and stuff but you know she won’t use them much and they will be too small in a blink of an eye anyway.\\r\\nAgnes: None taken, Alice. I just thought that diapers are kinda impersonal and she won’t even remember who she got them from.\\r\\nAlice: Sure, I get it. I just know that my baby shower gift turned out not to be very useful in a long term.\\r\\nKathy: Guys, how about some compromise? Both ideas are great so maybe we can buy a cheaper onesie, e.g. <file_other> and put it in a basket surrounded by diapers? Look: <file_photo>\\r\\nJane: Now that’s something worth considering.\\r\\nAlice: Win-win\\r\\nAgnes: I still think clothes are better, but we live in a world of democracy, so I won’t argue.\\r\\nKathy: Don’t be like this, Agnes…\\r\\nAgnes: Like what?\\r\\nAlice: A bitch?\\r\\nAgnes: EXCUSE ME? Did you just call me a B WORD?!?!?!?!\\r\\nJane: Oh boy\\r\\nAlice: Yes, I did. We want to do something special for our friend and you’re acting like a princess, so unless you stop to do so, I’m going to call you this :)\\r\\nAgnes: I won’t listen to this bullshit. Goodbye, Alice.\\r\\nJane: Did you just removed her from the conversation?\\r\\nKathy: Come on, Agnes, this was mean, but she just wants what’s best for Ursula.\\r\\nAgnes: You want to add something, Kathy?\\r\\nKathy: No, let’s move on.                  Agnes wants to throw a baby shower for Ursula and suggests designer clothes as a gift. Alice opts for more practical gifts so Kathy suggests a compromise. Agnes thinks her suggestion is better. Agnes removed Alice from the conversation. Kathy thinks it was mean but wants to move on.                   5\n1321     13612101                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Maddie: Hi, where were you today? It was epic!\\r\\nKira: I heard! Jess text me before. Wish I'd gone now, but I was throwing up all morning!\\r\\nMaddie: must be your dad's cooking! You better now?\\r\\nKira: cheeky! No, just a bug... did Toby really jump out the window and run away!? Wish I'd seen that!\\r\\nMaddie: yeah, it was sick. The useless supply teacher tried to stop him, but he bolted. Deputy Dingbat was called and we all had to behave!\\r\\nKira: yeah! God, he is such a dick , hate him. \\r\\nMaddie: me too, he made us all write an apology to the supply bod about our bad behaviour, like we did anything?!\\r\\nKira: mind, that Toby is pretty fit!\\r\\nMaddie: yeah, I know, should have seen him run! He vaulted over the fence too!\\r\\nKira: are you dense or what? I meant He's HOT!\\r\\nMaddie: He's ok. I prefer his mate Zane. I'm sure he was staring at me all through Maths. \\r\\nKira: in your dreams! I hear him and Kate are an item. \\r\\nMaddie: Oh, I didn't know that.\\r\\nKira: That fat goth girl! I thought he had more taste!\\r\\nMaddie: Maybe just a rumour. You know what Kathy's like. Loves to spread stuff like that.\\r\\nKira: Do you reckon you have a chance with him? \\r\\nMaddie: Well Toby and him are going to be at Ben's 16th next Fri. We just rock up looking sexy and... who knows!\\r\\nKira: alright for you to say, I look the back end of a bus!\\r\\nMaddie: you look fabulous, girl. I'll do your contouring and those boys will melt, esp.with that new silver dress you've got!\\r\\nKira: you're a mate. I am soooooo looking forward to it! See you. Wonder if Toby's been excluded.\\r\\nMaddie: hope not! See ya!  Kira was sick, so she couldn't see Toby jumping out the window. Toby put his classmates into trouble, so they had to apologize for their bad behavior. Kira finds Toby hot, but Maddie prefers Zane. However, Zane probably date Kate. Anyway, Kira and Maddie will try to seduce Zane and Toby next Friday.                  5\n1402     13865418                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               May: Anyone fancy going to the museum today?\\nJamie: What’s on?\\nClaire: I’m not feeling so great, I’m out :(\\nMay: Do you need anything, dear?\\nClaire: I’m good, thanks.

Claire is sick, so she can't go.                  5\n1408     13680936                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Mrs. Johnson: Excuse me, Mr. McKinnley, I have a question.\\r\\nMr. McKinnley: Of course, Mrs. Johnson. What is it?\\r\\nMrs. Johnson: I was wondering... The project we're currently working on...\\r\\nMr. McKinnley: What about it?\\r\\nMrs. Johnson: I have some ideas which possibly could improve the workflow...\\r\\nMr. McKinnley: That's great! What do you have in mind?\\r\\nMrs. Johnson: We could move some funds for later and use what we have left for current affairs.\\r\\nMr. McKinnley: And how do we manage that?\\r\\nMrs. Johnson: That's simple. We budget them not for the current task, but for the next one.\\r\\nMr. McKinnley: And what good will come of this?\\r\\nMrs. Johnson: The initial phase will seem cheaper and as far as I know the next phase is more cost consuming. \\r\\nMr. McKinnley: That's actually not a bad idea. Let me ponder upon it and get back to you.                                                                                                                                        Mrs. Johnson suggests how to improve the work of the current project. She recommends saving money for the future, more expensive needs.

The TV and the computer were stolen. The computer contains confidential files. The police says they probably won't find the stolen objects. Jake is scared.                  5\n1456     13611400                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 George: Hi Peter. So what do you think about all this Brexit business?\\r\\nPeter: Don't even talk about it. I don't wanna even think about it.\\r\\nGeorge: Why not?\\r\\nPeter: I am starting to get depressed about it.\\r\\nGeorge: Why?\\r\\nPeter: The government have now used up 80% of the time available between the Referendum and the 29th March 2019 and have achieved precisely nothing. \\r\\nPeter: I can't put my finger on anything, not one thing, that has been agreed and signed off on.\\r\\nGeorge: That's what they said. \"Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed\". \\r\\nPeter: You know that Wilf Pareto, right?\\r\\nGeorge: The 80-20 rule guy? \\r\\nPeter: Yeah, him. He said you can do 80% of the work with 20% of the time, and I suppose the government must be trying to prove him right, because now that's all the time we've got left. \\r\\nGeorge:  Problem is, I don't think we did the other 20% of the work with the first 80% of the time. \\r\\nPeter: Don't even talk about it.\\r\\nGeorge: The issue is that May is useless and all the people in government have either no solutions or no ability to take command, and the EU negoiators intentionally sabotaged the process.\\r\\nPeter: The simplest thing to do now would be to simply withdraw Article 50, stay in and make as much trouble for Merkel and Macron as we possibly can so that they wish they had let us go when they had the chance.\\r\\nPeter: But let's leave the topic. I'd rather talk about just about anything else.                 George asks Peter about Brexit. Peter is upset about this topic. In his opinion the politicians don't work effectively. For Peter the simplest thing to do would be to withdraw Article 50, stay in and make much trouble for Merkel and Macron. Peter would rather talk about something else.                  5\n1459     13814339                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Sally: here's the raw version of the material for the radio :P without translation, a bit undone but lv promised to send it :P\\r\\nHannah: THANKS SO MUCH\\r\\nSally: but omg, the translation is so terrible \\r\\nHannah: REAlly? why?\\r\\nSally: she spelled your name and surname incorrectly also the American words\\r\\nHannah: Really??\\r\\nSally: Austin is spelled sooo wrong.

Hope you two are fine.\\r\\nOlivia: Hello dear Lilly, I'm so thrilled that your stay here brings back such happy memories. :o)\\r\\nOlivia: More drama with Bill... He had an emergency op on his eye due to retina displacement. 5 tears in the retina... As you can imagine we've now learned a great deal about the eye! LOL\\r\\nLilly: Oh my dear Olivia! Now thank you for the update on Bill, we are all worried then. A torn retina and a new operation. How did it happen??\\r\\nLilly: Exertion, sudden movement, weakened veins? What are the prospects? Please tell us more.\\r\\nOlivia: There were 5 tears and probably caused by the cataract op. The doc is happy with the progress after a week of recovering the eye.\\r\\nLilly: Can Bill use the eye?\\r\\nOlivia: He can see some fuzzy outline of objects. Colour is distorted, mainly green and blue.\\r\\nLilly: And what are the prospects?\\r\\nOlivia: Progress will be slow up to 6 months of vision gradually changing. He has to to take things easy and only gentle walks.\\r\\nLilly: I suppose that suits him fine. Him always preferring a sedentary lifestyle.\\r\\nOlivia: But one obvious torture: during this time alcohol, in any form, is strictly forbidden.\\r\\nLilly: How is he coping?\\r\\nOlivia: Barely so. I gave up hope long ago. But so far he's been dry.\\r\\nOlivia: At this stage the doc says his vision should return. This is encouraging.\\r\\nLilly: Fingers crossed!!\\r\\nLilly: Please give Bill our love!             Bill had an emergency op in his eye due to a retina displacement. He had 5 tears in his retina, probably caused by the cataract op. Now he's recovering and he can see some fuzzy outline of objects, with distorted colors. He needs to reduce his physical activity and refrain from alcohol.                    5\n1621     13729849                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Mark: hiii\\r\\nSarah: hii :)\\r\\nMark: are we still on for next weekend to the mountains?\\r\\nSarah: YES I can't wait haha have you talked to everyone else to see if there all still coming?

I did not see it coming at all, I haven’t had a bad episode like that for such a long time. \\r\\nGary: So what happened exactly? Was dad with you?\\r\\nMary: No I was in the library, dad stayed at home. He was fixing the trailer and wanted to finish before dark\\r\\nGary: Did you feel dizzy again?\\r\\nMary: I started feeling dizzy and quickly sat down, then I fainted I think. When I woke up the lady from the library had called an ambulance and dad\\r\\nLaura: She called Steve?\\r\\nMary: Yeah, benefit if you have been going to the same library for 40 years! \\r\\nGary: Hahaha safe place to faint mum!\\r\\nMum: she actually is Becky’s cousin, from next door, and lived next door for a while so we know her quite well. \\r\\nLaura: handy! What did the paramedics say?\\r\\nMary: They weren’t sure so I went to hospital to get checked over. Now they wonder whether it is heart issue. I have to go for more tests next week. \\r\\nGary: Do they know all the medication you are on? It might be something to do with that cocktail of drugs…\\r\\nMary: I know its quite a bit isn’t it?\\r\\nGary: How is dad doing? He must have had a shock receiving that call from the library lady! \\r\\nMary: He is ok. He was annoyed that he didn’t get his trailer sorted. \\r\\nGary: Typical!\\r\\nMary: he has been ever so good since though, he has cooked and everything!\\r\\nLaura: wow!\\r\\nMary: Anyway we are fine lovely, thanks you for asking \\r\\nGary: Let me know how the tests go next week, when are they?\\r\\nMary: Tuesday.

Christmas :-(\\r\\nLaura: But you said that you would.\\r\\nKas: I know. It looks like I'll have to stay in the house over Christmas to keep the heating going and work right through to pay the bills.\\r\\nLaura: Can't you get anyone to mind the house and feed the cats and dogs?\\r\\nKas: I wish but even if I could I still have to work over Christmas to get some money.\\r\\nKas: Besides work has decided to wind down my hours so from Christmas onward I'll only have 7.5hrs per week over 4 days.\\r\\nLaura: That doesn't sound good.\\r\\nKas: Nope. I'll have to find another job now. Which sucks big time!                                                                                 Kas is not visiting Laura in December. Kas' other housemates are going home for Christmas and Kas has to stay in the house. Kas has to work over Christmas. Kas was made to work less hours. Kas will have to find a new job.                  5\n1780     13729449                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Heather: Dad, everything ok?\\r\\nPeter: Heather, love, your sister's just been on, she's popping over with some dinner in half an hour.\\r\\nHeather: Just worried about you, after all, it's only been 2 weeks. Glad Stace is coming over.\\r\\nPeter: Twins ok, lovey and Alistair?\\r\\nHeather: Well, they've been off nursery with a nasty bug, but they're going back tomorrow, thank goodness! I'm working tomorrow, so that fits in well. Ali is ok, busy as ever!\\r\\nPeter: Do they understand what happened with Mum?\\r\\nHeather: Well, they saw Nanna was getting smaller and smaller in hospital and I told them she was very very ill and tried to explain about what will happen, but, no, I don't think they get it.\\r\\nPeter: Well, they are only 3, they won't really remember her.\\r\\nHeather: Maybe, but I am always talking about Mum to them, so they hopefully will understand when they're older. Course, there's all the photos too.\\r\\nPeter: You're doing the right thing, love, mum would do the same. It seems so odd here now.\\r\\nHeather: Dad, you need to get out and about whenever you can, stop you dwelling on it.\\r\\nPeter: Bit difficult after 45 years not to dwell on it, maybe I want to!\\r\\nHeather: Fair enough. Look, I'll pop over with the kids after school, bring a cake, we'll have a cup of tea.\\r\\nPeter: You and your sister are determined to fatten me up!

WAS. PERFECT.\\r\\nMichael: hahahaha, thought you may like it :D\\r\\nMichael: I must admit I was waiting for something like this, finally the plot is back.\\r\\nJane: I was enjoying it even without the plot ;)\\r\\nMichael: Well, not everyone is satisfied with just looking at Jensen Ackles ;P\\r\\nJane: Which I don't understand.\\r\\nJane: But yeah, it was a great ep. I'm glad we've seen more hunting stuff and they've finally decided to paint Mommy dear out of the picture.\\r\\nMichael: I agree, I was so fed up with this. I don't get why they brought her back in the first place.\\r\\nJane: Ran out of ideas probably, but come on. I could've understood them if they brought her back only for one season, ok, but more?\\r\\nMichael: Tell me more. Especially, as it seems that they focused more on her than the boys.\\r\\nJane: And there's less and less Castiel :( Not a good sign\\r\\nMichael: I love this show, but I must admit I came close to letting it go.\\r\\nJane: me too... I had a break when season 9 was on, but I was feeling nostalgic once and here I am again XD\\r\\nMichael: At least we've got one really good episode after 3 awful seasons :D                                Jane and Michael enjoyed watching the last episode. Jane is happy to see more hunting and Mommy written out. She is not happy with seeing less of Castiel. Jane took a break from watching after season 9. Michael is happy to see an interesting episode after 3 bad seasons.                  5\n1865     13820524                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Rick: What are we doing with the New Year's Eve?\\r\\nAlfred: What about that plan with Jim's fathers house? Is that still on?\\r\\nJim: I spoke with him yesterday, he agreed to give us the keys. Just that it will be dirty, no one was there for almost 6 months\\r\\nAlfred: Amazing :D\\r\\nRick: So how many people are we inviting? We need to organise everything fast, it is in less than 3 weeks\\r\\nAlfred: True, how many people CAN we even invite? How big is the house?\\r\\nJim: There are 6 beds, two of which are king sized. But there is a lot of room, so people can sleep anywhere ;)\\r\\nAlfred: We also need to think about transportation\\r\\nJim: I will drive there and can take 4 people. But getting there by public transportation really sucks :/\\r\\nAlfred: Should we ask in the class group?\\r\\nJim: I will write there in a second\\r\\nAlfred: Ok, we will see what they say and plan the rest later\\r\\nRick: We can give them until Sunday to reply?\\r\\nJim: Ok, I will mention that :)                                         Jim, Rick and Alfred are organizing the New Year's Eve in Jim's father's house. It is less than 3 weeks to go. The house is quite big but dirty. They also need to organize transportation amongst other things. Jim will inform and invite friends on a class group.                  5\n1866     13812773                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Joanna: My doctor told me that I shouldn't be doing yoga any more.\\r\\nPaula: Why is that?\\r\\nJoanna: He said there's something wrong with my back.\\r\\nPaula: That doesn't necessary mean you need to stop doing yoga.\\r\\nJoanna: Well, that's what he said. I'm not a doctor.\\r\\nPaula: But does he know what kind of yoga you do?\\r\\nJoanna: Hahaha, like he cares\\r\\nPaula: See? Btw, what kind of yoga you do actually? :D\\r\\nJoanna: I tried different, but now I'm going to ashtanga classes.\\r\\nPaula: Hm... It is quite strenuous.\\r\\nJoanna: So what do you suggest?\\r\\nPaula: I don't know what's wrong with your back, but I'd rather go for sivananda.\\r\\nJoanna: I tried it at the beginning, but I found it boring to be honest...\\r\\nPaula: Not if you have a good teacher.\\r\\nJoanna: Could you recommend me someone then?\\r\\nPaula: Of course I can! With pleasure!\\r\\nPaula: I go to Lotus studio, call them and ask for classes with Tina. She's amazing.\\r\\nJoanna: Thank you! I love doing yoga, I was feeling really bummed out when the doctor told me to quit.\\r\\nPaula: I don't think that you have to. Maybe you could bring all your medical files to consult?\\r\\nJoanna: Is this possible?\\r\\nPaula: There's one therapist, you know, just in case someone's injured. He can have a look and advise you which exercise you can do and which to avoid.\\r\\nJoanna: That'd be wonderful!                                           Joanna's doctor forbid her to do yoga because she has back problems. She does ashtanga yoga. She find sivanada yoga boring. Paula goes to Lotus studio for classes with Tina. Joanna will try this class and bring her medical files to consult with the therapist.                  5\n1925     13681373

Bob won't call parents, if Rose won't tell them about his party.                   5\n2051     13730767                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Kim: Hi Jojo!!

someone has to tell maria to stop oversharing stuff on facebook\\r\\nNicholas: did you see her latest post?\\r\\nDiane: no, what was it about?\\r\\nNicholas: she rambled on and on and on about her love life\\r\\nNicholas: and how she woud probably end up alone\\r\\nDiane: she does that all the time :-/\\r\\nDiane: i've hinted at her a couple of times that she should think twice before posting something like that\\r\\nDiane: but i think she hasn't really gotten the hint\\r\\nNicholas: i feel bad for her\\r\\nNicholas: because now i'm getting texts from all our friends in common making fun of her\\r\\nNicholas: and talking behind her back :-(\\r\\nDiane: do you think we should step up and do something?\\r\\nDiane: maybe have an honest conversation and tell her to stop posting for a while?\\r\\nNicholas: if that was me i'd appreciate it if my friends actually stepped in to help\\r\\nDiane: i don't want to embarass her\\r\\nDiane: i don't want to make her feel bad :-(\\r\\nNicholas: it'll be worse if we don't do anything and remain quiet\\r\\nNicholas: maria is a good friend and we should be good friends to her\\r\\nNicholas: i can talk to her or we can do it together\\r\\nDiane: it's better if i do it\\r\\nDiane: i'll ask her out for coffee and tell her about the oversharing\\r\\nDiane: and what people are saying bedind her back\\r\\nNicholas: thanks for doing that\\r\\nNicholas: you're a good friend                                      Maria shares too much on Facebook which bothers Nicholas. Her last post was about her love life. Diane talked to her about that before. Nicholas is getting messages from their common friends that laugh at her and gossip. Diane will talk to her again over a coffee.                  5\n2290     13730410                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Diana: How much do you charge for an hour lesson?\\r\\nKas: It is 12GBP per hour in house plus milage.\\r\\nKas: At the moment I have the following slots available: Weekends, after 4pm on Thursday and all day Friday.\\r\\nDiana: I would want lessons for my 12 year old daughter. Do you teach children?\\r\\nKas: Yes we do although we mainly teach adults.\\r\\nDiana: We live in Nailsea. Can you come and teach her on Tuesdays at 4pm?\\r\\nKas: Unfortunately Tuesdays are already fully booked. But I can teach her on Thursday or Friday. However I would have to charge milage to come out.\\r\\nKas: Milage is 50p per mile there and back.\\r\\nKas: Nialsea is 10 miles from us so that would make 22GBP per hour if I come out to you.\\r\\nDiana: That is really expensive. Fuel doesn't cost that much!!!\\r\\nKas: That's true but I have to charge for my time and travel time is still time.\\r\\nDiana: OK. Thanks for the info. We'll think about it.\\r\\nKas: If you want to keep the costs down you can always come to our place. We do teach from home.                     Kas charges 12 pounds per lesson plus 50p per mile there and back for mileage. Kas is available on weekends, on Thursday after 4 PM and all day on Friday. Kas teaches children as well. It would cost 22 pounds per hour, if Kas came to Nialsea for lessons. Kas teaches from home too.                  5\n2309     13820621

Little hangover, but I'm fine in general :)\\r\\nDenis: How about you?\\r\\nDenis: Yesterday evening you were so wasted, I had to force your body into a cab and come along because driver refused to drive you alone\\r\\nJake: Lol! I can't remember any of it.\\r\\nDenis: :/ You were hardly concious. \\r\\nJake: Sorry mate. And thank you ;)\\r\\nJake: Did you enjoy the party?\\r\\nDenis: Haha. Party was great. Until you decided to throw up on my new shirt :P\\r\\nJake: Seriously I did that? I have no memory of the party after midnight ;(\\r\\nDenis: Nah, I'm joking. You just got drunk and after exhausting dancing you just had one shot that was too much and you just got wasted.\\r\\nDenis: You almost fell asleep leaning agaist the bar.\\r\\nDenis: We let you sleep a bit, drank few more shots, and then decided to get you a cab.\\r\\nDenis: By the way, have you eaten something yesteday at all?\\r\\nDenis: It's not normal for you to get drunk so easily :P\\r\\nJake: You got the point. Drining vodka having an empty stomach is never a good idea.\\r\\nJake: I had dinner around 4 and since then I didn't have a chance to eat anything.\\r\\nJake: My mistake :P\\r\\nDenis: Big mistake. Get well bro. Next time we firstly go to a restaurant. Then to a club :P\\r\\nJake: Maybe it's a good idea. Get well too. And thank you!\\r\\nDenis: No problem. Yo.                                   Denis is a bit hangover. Yesterday Jake was really drunk and Denis had to help him enter a cab. Jake almost fell asleep at the party and drank a couple of shots. Jake didn't eat anything since 4 that day. Jake and Denis will eat something before they drink next time.                  5\n2618     13611594

What say you? :P\\r\\nBrittany: Go on.\\r\\nChandler: I'll TRY to write a one-shot (not to publish or anything), but only if you send me a new chapter of your fic. [I hope I'm not coming off as rude - If I am, I'm sorry. I just thought it would be beneficial for the both of us...]\\r\\nBrittany: I like it! Okay, let's do this! :D\\r\\nChandler: Great!! :D Shake on it? *Offers hand*\\r\\nBrittany: *Shakes* You've got yourself a deal, kind sir. ;)\\r\\nBrittany: Although I might not have it ready for this week - there's a lot of stuff that I've got to take care off...\\r\\nChandler: Hey, chill - it's not prob. ;) Just send it whenever\\r\\nChandler: I'm seriously excited.\\r\\nBrittany: *blushes* Oh, stop it you.\\r\\nChandler: No, seriously - I mean it!\\r\\nChandler: You're a seriously talented writer! Have you thought about writing your own book?\\r\\nBrittany: Sometimes...\\r\\nChandler: You sreally should! :) btw, what would it be about?\\r\\nBrittany: Thanks :)\\r\\nBrittany: Well... ;) My idea is to write a story in a universe where there are four types of people: the superheroes, the villains, the side-kicks and the civilians. The main character would be a classic side-kick, who thinks he's really unlucky because he always gets into various embarassing situations (like accidentally stepping in dog poo, tripping at inoportune moments...)\\r\\nBrittany: Except here's the plot twist - it's later revealed that during all those *unlucky* situations, he was actually saving someone from a villain without realising it.\\r\\nChandler: Making your MC an unlikely hero. That's brilliant! I can totally imagine that as a comic book or anime film :)                                                                          Chandler will try to write a one-shot only if Brittany sends him a new chapter of her fic. She agrees. Chandler likes her work a lot. She sometimes thinks about writing her own book. The main character would be an unlikely hero.                  5\n2777     13611754                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Linda: Hey there missy.

April may look for a mattress tomorrow.                  5\n2877     13819237

Amber... \\r\\nLora: Nothing's wrong with you, it's Ted to be blamed for ruining everything\\r\\nAmber: I've been trying so hard to be a good girlfriend...\\r\\nAmber: I still don't know where I did a mistake, we seemed to be complementing each other\\r\\nAmber: And suddenly he said it's over, that he doesn't love me anymore and there's another girl...\\r\\nNicole: Gosh, you've really been through hell because of him, it sounds like a nightmare\\r\\nAmber: It still hurts, the nightmare still lasts...\\r\\nNicole: I'm so sorry Amber...\\r\\nNicole: I'd really like to help you in some way, I can imagine how I'd feel in such a terrible situation\\r\\nLora: Listen girls, maybe you'd like to go somewhere this evening and have a drink?\\r\\nLora: It's Friday. It'd be much better to go out than sitting and thinking all alone\\r\\nLora: Amber... we should meet and talk and have some fun too. Let us help you\\r\\nAmber: Okay, I can go somewhere. Can't stand being alone, it's killing me...\\r\\nNicole: Fine girls. Please, let me know where you're staying. I need to take care of a few things first but then I'm free\\r\\nLora: Sure, no problem.

Teddy left Amber half a year ago. She misses him. She is still depressed. Lora will take her out for drinks to cheer her up. Nicole will join.                   5\n2902     13611922                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Rick: Hey, what up?\\r\\nDiddy: Nothin much. Whatcha doing?\\r\\nRick: I was thinking about going to the baseball game today. Wanna come?\\r\\nDiddy: Maybe, who are we playing tonight?\\r\\nRick: New York\\r\\nDiddy: You think we can get tickets? It's always hard when they're in town.\\r\\nRick: Yeah, there'll always be some, just gotta go down and see. If not, we'll do something downtown.\\r\\nDiddy: Cool. Did you see last night's game against the Royals? We killed 'em.\\r\\nRick: I just caught the last 2 innings, but I saw the Bichette homer, it was a monster!\\r\\nDiddy: Yeah, one of the longest ones hit this year. I'm feeling this could be our year\\r\\nRick: Yeah, it's looking good.\\r\\nDiddy: Hey, you have any Jays caps or jerseys or something?\\r\\nRick: I just have 1 cap. Didn't you have the Jays shirt?\\r\\nDiddy: Yeah, but it's in the wash. I don't wanna wear a stinky tee :)\\r\\nRick: Buy something at the game then.\\r\\nDiddy: Yeah, right. You know the prices there.\\r\\nRick: Anyways, let's meet up at 5 at Islington station, ok?\\r\\nDiddy: Ok, but I might be late. I don't get out till 4 and then it's gonna take me a while through traffic.\\r\\nRick: Ok, no problem. I'll be waiting.\\r\\nDiddy: If we have time, let's grab something to eat before the game.\\r\\nRick: Ok, but hurry your ass.

Rick has a cap but Diddy's shirt is dirty. In case they can't get tickets they will do something downtown. They arrange to meet at 5 but Diddy might be late.                  5\n2970     13681473                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Rhys: Hello dear holidaymakers! Are you coming back tomorrow or on Monday? I have to know because of the key.\\r\\nVictoria: Hi Rhys, we should arrive late in the evening tomorrow. Traffic shouldn't be too bad. But don't bother about the entrance key, I've got my own with me.\\r\\nRhys: I know. But I think Thomas will need his on Monday.\\r\\nVictoria: True enough. Stupid me. Everything OK at home? Burglaries? Hail storms? Power cuts?\\r\\nRhys: Not this sort of entertainment I'm afraid. But we had a vicious downpour last night. Afterwards I drove to your house to check the basement but everything's fine.\\r\\nVictoria: Thank you Rhys. You're so reliable!\\r\\nRhys: Another thing. Your neighbour told me there was a huge red cat prowling in your garden the other day. I clean forgot to tell you earlier.\\r\\nVictoria: Oh my God!! It can be Oscar!! When was it?\\r\\nRhys: I thought so. No idea when he saw him. He wasn't sure himself.\\r\\nVictoria: Oh Rhys PLEASE !! In the basement there's plenty of cat's food, tins and stuff. And his bowls are there too. Could you please put them nicely out under the terrace roof? If it's Oscar, it will keep him near home. Please!\\r\\nRhys: I thought about it. But then if it's not him and you end up with some strange cat?\\r\\nVictoria: I don't mind. I love them all. Will you? I know it's a bother but the very idea of Oscar coming back home after all these months and we're not there...\\r\\nRhys: Calm down Vicky! I'll do it. I liked your tom too.\\r\\nVictoria: Thank you Rhys very very much. You are a darling.\\r\\nRhys: Don't exaggerate ;) And give me a call when you're back.\\r\\nVictoria: XXXX       Rhys wants to know when Victoria comes back from holidays because he needs the key for Thomas. There was a downpour and Rhys checked Victoria's basement. Her neighbour told Rhys he saw a cat in her garden. It could have been Oscar. Victoria asks Rhys to put out some food to keep the cat around.                  5\n2977     13680284                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Tessy: Good morning Harry! Just thought I'd drop you a line before disappearing to the other side of the world. At the moment I'm on the train to Frankfurt airport, then off to Cuba for 5 weeks. Can't wait to be there!\\r\\nHarry: A very good morning to you dear Tessy! How nice you are in touch. So travelling again? Gosh, you've got stamina!\\r\\nTessy: I wonder myself. Truth to tell I'm slightly apprehensive. Never been to Cuba. Have you?\\r\\nHarry: No, I'm not that adventurous but Maya was. Last summer with her boys. And I think she was very enthusiastic.But I remember no details. Why don't you ask her? She may have a tip or two.\\r\\nTessy: A bit too late now :)) but I will definitely contact her. Still she can give me a few good tips. Do you remember if internet is really such a disaster there?\\r\\nHarry: Oh yes, it is. She was gone for 2 weeks and I heard from her twice: from the Havana airport when she arrived and on leaving.\\r\\nTessy: I see! My Super Mario boss is expecting me to be online all the time - just in case. LOL\\r\\nHarry: What a charming person. Have you told him to fuck off?\\r\\nTessy: More or less. And hey how are you? Tied down to the ground?\\r\\nHarry: I hate winter for that reason. But still had a fantastic flying season this year. Can't complain really. We've been thinking about a skiing holiday though at Xmas.\\r\\nTessy: Smashing! Where to?\\r\\nHarry: Actually that's an adventurous part - to Israel. They seem to have some incredible slopes with topnotch infrastructure. A bloke from Notts Club was there last year and couldn't praise it too much.\\r\\nTessy: Funny enough I remember seeing their skiing brochures when we were there back in 2000. Sooo long time ago. By now it can be only better. Wouldn't it bit more on a pricey side?\\r\\nHarry: We'll manage 2 weeks. And it can't be more expensive that Austria.Not to mention Switzerland. They're gone mad there, with all those Chinks and Russkis. Nobody else can afford it any more.\\r\\nTessy: Apart from royals in Kitzbühel :)) \\r\\nHarry: Molly has found out about a package, with the flight, full board, accommodation. You only have to pay your ski passes.\\r\\nTessy: And that's where they are making their money! And on apres-skis!\\r\\nHarry: I can easily give a miss to a fancy apres-ski! Have you had any bookings? They surely have nice all-inclusive places in Cuba.\\r\\nTessy: Not at all! Otherwise prices are exorbitant. But those affordable ones always have horrible write-ups. Yes, I've booked all my accommodation. Airbnb, I like to support the locals :)\\r\\nHarry: Very noble of you. But it's a bit of a tossup: you can get a superb flat or land in a rubbish hip. I definitely prefer hotels.\\r\\nTessy: I AM more adventurous. Anyway it is safe, Cuba is said to be very safe even for woman travelling alone.\\r\\nHarry: And ravishing blonde on top of it! But be careful.\\r\\nTessy: STB you are.\\r\\nHarry: What the hell is STB?\\r\\nTessy: Swet Talking Bastard. Anyway it was great to chat with you. I think we're approaching Frankfurt. So see you in January!\\r\\nTessy: And have a fantastic skiing Xmas!\\r\\nHarry: Happy and safe trails Tessy!                                       Tessy is going to Cuba for 5 weeks.

Maybe she needs sometime to open up?\\r\\nLiliana: I don’t know, dad, I think she’s just a weirdo.\\r\\nLiliana: Nevertheless I’ll try to get along with her - what else can I do?\\r\\nJohn: And that’s the right attitude, darling. :)                                                                                                                                               Liliana has a new job.

everything fine?\\r\\nTina: well, not sure at the moment, I must take care of my garden cause now I'm depending on 1 of our neighbours\\r\\nMeg: ok, I see.\\r\\nTina: she's cool, but Im not comfortable how she waters our plants\\r\\nTina: I'll try to come at least for the beginning to say hello.\\r\\nTina: and how was the wedding? did you go?\\r\\nMeg: no :( it was cancelled 1.5 weeks before!\\r\\nMeg: I was planning to go to Cracow for the weekend with my friend. \\r\\nMeg: but we gave up the idea on Thursday and I didnt want to make a mess with the lesson, as it was cancelled a long time ago already\\r\\nTina: OMG, but why was it cancelled?\\r\\nMeg: some facts about the groom came to light\\r\\nMeg: and the girl (with her parents) decided not to get married. Everyone was shocked\\r\\nTina: oh my God, thats really shocking. Maybe better they decided not to get married 1.5 weeks before than on the wedding day ;)\\r\\nMeg: yes, exactly! :)\\r\\nMeg: it would be much worse if she had married him and had some serious problems because of that   Last Sat the lesson was cancelled. Tina was in the country, Meg was supposed to go to a wedding that was cancelled only 1.5 weeks in advance. The girl learned some facts about the groom and decided not to marry. Meg was available, but didn't want to make mess with the lesson. Tina wants to pay Meg.                  5\n3878     13680292                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Brenda: Hello bro, you've got an invalid sister. I fell in the bathroom and badly hit my side. Can hardly move now.\\r\\nAndy: Good gracious! How did you manage that?\\r\\nBrenda: The floor was wet after I had a shower and I wanted to shake the rug, moved too fast, slipped, and hit with a thump my left side below the breast against the edge of the bathtub. Took my breath away for a sec. I even yelled or groaned or gasped. Anyway I was on the floor, shocked. Absolutely shocked. I thought, so that's how it happens. But I managed to get up and didn't realise the pain until I stretched to put my nighty on. Oh bro... Horrible....\\r\\nAndy: You could have killed yourself. Where are you now?\\r\\nBrenda: In bed. But I can hardly move. It's very painful all over the body. SHIIIIT!\\r\\nAndy: Maybe you should call in an ambulance? Are you sure you haven't broken something? A rib?\\r\\nBrenda: No, then I'd be howling with pain. It's just the impact of the fall that has, I don't know, damaged the tissue. Whatever I have here. Fat I suppose. It has to heal by itself.\\r\\nAndy: Can you breath normally?\\r\\nBrenda: Yes. I can't take a deep breath though.\\r\\nAndy: Can you touch your bruised side? Is it swollen? Red?\\r\\nBrenda: I can touch it, not press of course, but stroke. No, it isn't swollen. The skin is as usual, no discolouration. But this will come later, I suppose.\\r\\nAndy: Not necessarily. It might as well remain unaffected. I mean the epidermis, the skin itself. Though I'd expect it to develop a bruise.\\r\\nAndy: Are you coughing? Coughing blood?\\r\\nBrenda: God! No! I'll see how I feel in the morning. I just need a rest. I feel so rotten, bro...\\r\\nAndy: My worry would be that you've damaged something inside you. You know, split spleen, punctured lung.That sort of thing.You just watch your body.\\r\\nBrenda: Yes, I will. I understand what you mean. I thought so as well. Just see how I feel tomorrow morning. Fucking hell! I can hardly pull myself up.\\r\\nAndy: If I were you, I would go and see the doc first thing in the morning.\\r\\nBrenda: And he'll send me to have an x-ray. I can't bear the thought of driving or even walking.\\r\\nAndy: Well, he can come to your place and you'll be driven to hospital in an ambulance.\\r\\nBrenda: You stop scaring the shit out of me! I am not that invalid. It's just bloody painful but I think I'm in one piece.\\r\\nAndy: I don't know Brenda. One shouldn't take it too light those falls. You may still be in a state of shock and are underrating your condition. Will you phone me first thing in the morning please? Still from bed? Luise is gone by 7:30, so you won't be waking anyone up.\\r\\nBrenda: OK brother. I will give you a call. Of course if I'm still alive.\\r\\nAndy: Sister!! Anyway I wish you a good night's sleep. Have a good rest!\\r\\nBrenda: Thanks bro. Sleep tight too. \\r\\nBrenda: And don't worry about me.                       Brenda fell in the bathroom and badly hit her site. She is now in bed with a lot of pains. She can't take a deep breath. Her brother, Andy, is afraid she damaged something inside her body and tells her to watch it. He wants her to call him in the morning to report how she feels.                  5\n4025   13728747-1

question for you\\r\\nMonique: hello, listening\\r\\nGloria: cause I've heard that you'll be collecting our student IDs tomorrow\\r\\nMonique: yep\\r\\nGloria: unfortunately I won't be at the uni tomorrow and can't pass it to anyone else to deliver it to you, what should I do then?\\r\\nMonique: I'll ask at the deanary tomorrow and say that you're sick or something. maybe they'll be more symphatetic then\\r\\nGloria: I'll be very grateful if you could do it\\r\\nMonique: no problem, you're not the only one actually so they'll have to adjust to the situation and wait for others to give the ID later\\r\\nGloria: uf.....I thought I was the only one\\r\\nMonique: don't worry.\\r\\nGloria: thank you again. Btw, have you done this strange homework they gave us from literature?\\r\\nMonique: not yet, I haven't even looked at it\\r\\nGloria: good for you, it's fucked up\\r\\nMonique: as every homework from this subject :P\\r\\nGloria: good point xD ok, thank you again :D\\r\\nMonique: no problem :) bye                        Monique is collecting student IDs but Gloria won't be at the uni tomorrow. Gloria can't deliver it either. Monique will let them know that Gloria is sick. Monique reckons they will have to collect IDs later as there are more people absent. Monique hasn't done her homework yet.                   5\n4078     13828309                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Sang: Man, what happened last night?\\r\\nKen: Hahahahhehehehe u don’t remember, doncha?\\r\\nSang: No I don’t, talk to me!!!\\r\\nKen: What’s the last thing u remember ;>\\r\\nSang: Entering the club\\r\\nKen: Dude, theres a whole story that u missed!\\r\\nSang: Tell meeeee\\r\\nKen: Fine, after the first bottle of vodka you already got wasted\\r\\nSang: THE FIRST?

That sounds cool!\\r\\nJacob: <file_other>\\r\\nJacob: Here's their website, check them out.

And? What is your news? Are you getting much work these days?\\r\\nGina: Hi there! Can't complain. Just enough commissions to keep me busy without overworking. Enough money too. And you?\\r\\nMash: I still work about 12-15 hours a week, which with my rental means that I am not dipping into my savings too much.\\r\\nGina: Sounds good. Is this journal Rose was an editor of still around?\\r\\nMash: Amazingly ATLA has continued for another year in 2018. I have always believed that they would not stop publishing it, or change how they produce it, in the middle of a year’s editions, so I am now at that stage of waiting for the first paper of the 2019 edition to arrive on my desk. Each year I think it will stop, and each year, somehow, it staggers on! Fingers crossed.\\r\\nGina: Fingers crossed. Happy for you. And Rose's ALTA. How is she?\\r\\nMash: Don't see much of them. The last do we had together was in November! Michael's birthday party at Carriage and Stallion in Buxton. But I hear they're doing well. Rose's granddaughter will be graduating from college this summer. You met her, remember?\\r\\nGina: Tina?\\r\\nMash: Tilla. A short for some name but can't remember.\\r\\nGina: Always wanted to ask you: how old is Rose?\\r\\nMash: Not sure. My age? Must be older as she's bound to be getting her pension by now.\\r\\nGina: Has she retired yet?!\\r\\nMash: So I hear. ALTA secretary told me the other day.\\r\\nGina: And you, old man?\\r\\nMash: I get my state pension in 2021. But not having paid much into my pension plan I can't expect it entirely to support me.\\r\\nGina: And the estate? The rents?\\r\\nMash: That will do, though I'd have to cut on booze\\r\\nMash: D‑':\\r\\nMash: The smallholding is looking fairly neat these days (mainly due to Hellie). So I don’t work too hard there, but over the course of a year, I probably spend 4-5 hours a week working on it. Through butcher problems, we kept our pigs for a month longer than we expected this year, and in that time they grew by about 15-20 kilos each!. So my freezers are full to overflowing.\\r\\nGina: Pork is not good for you, they say. Especially for older folks.\\r\\nMash: We have decided to give the pigs a rest next year, since we should have plenty of meat. I really don't care if it's healthy or not as long as it tastes good.\\r\\nGina: Good old Mash!\\r\\nMash: It's me!\\r\\nGina: How grand to hear your news! \\r\\nMash: You must come and visit me again.\\r\\nGina: We'll think about it!\\r\\nMash: :)    Gina has enough commissions to keep herself busy and they bring her enough money. Mash works about 12-15 hours per week, which also works for him. The ALTA journal is still going strong. The last time Mash saw Rose was in November at Michael's birthday party.

What do you think about Brexit?\\r\\nHarry: I think it was not necessary \\r\\nHenry: Yep\\r\\nHenry: you knew that the guy which came up with the idea of Brexit resigned from his position?\\r\\nFrederick: seriously? I didn't know that\\r\\nHarry: yea, me too\\r\\nHenry: and what will happen with all the people who are living there for not so long and they are foreigners\\r\\nFrederick: It is a good question\\r\\nHarry: I have heard that people who stayed there for like 5 years or so will not have problems with staying in GB\\r\\nHenry: i've also heard that\\r\\nHenry: and what will happen with those who had been living there for a shorter period of time?\\r\\nFrederick: I think that they must on Teresa's mercy\\r\\nHarry: hah, I think there will be no mercy for them\\r\\nHenry: I also think the same way, they will be deported and their journey in GB will end                            Harry thinks Brexit was not necessary. The guy who came up with this idea resigned from his position. People who have stayed in GB for more than 5 years will be able to stay. The fate of those with less than 5 years is uncertain. Harry and Henry think they will be deported.                  5\n4256     13612178                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Kevin: Good morning Sunshine! <file_photo>\\r\\nGina: Morning Bear! <file_photo>\\r\\nKevin: What's this tasty bit?\\r\\nGina: My left thigh.

And you?\\r\\nKevin: Tossing and turning for a half a night trying not to think about you too much.\\r\\nGina: Should I feel guilty about it?\\r\\nKevin: In a way... When shall I see you? Before the next weekend?\\r\\nGina: I have to sort out a few things at home. Not to mention the lectures. May be tight this week.\\r\\nKevin: Shall we go and have a meal in the evening then?\\r\\nGina: Well I might be partial!\\r\\nKevin: Thursday? Wednesday? Tuesday?\\r\\nGina: Friday.\\r\\nKevin: But it's nearly weekend!\\r\\nGina: But after a sumptuous meal we can go to my place and you'll stay till Monday.\\r\\nKevin: Killing!!!

Is it a flat or a house?\\r\\nFiona: House, I share it with 10 people, can you imagine?\\r\\nIan: What?! 10 people?!\\r\\nFiona: I know, sounds terrible, but it's cool, really. We get along really well, what are the odds?\\r\\nIan: But you have your own room or are you sharing?\\r\\nFiona: Ok, not that social, I have my own room :)\\r\\nIan: That must be a huge house...\\r\\nFiona: Hahaha, yeah, it is quite big. It's quite difficult to get your head around at first, we have a patio and there's an extension there were two people live. There are also three floors, so we fit quite all right.\\r\\nIan: Glad to hear that :) Is it somewhere central? Is the neighbourhood safe?\\r\\nFiona: The whole country is safe, trust me, it's probably the safest place on earth as there's literally nothing happening here.\\r\\nFiona: I think the last time someone was murdered here was decades ago :P\\r\\nIan: Very funny :P\\r\\nFiona: I don't live in the central area, but I have couple of buses to choose and it takes around 20 minutes to get to the old town.Told you - pretty cool ;)\\r\\nFiona: <file_photo>\\r\\nFiona: Here's the old town. The city is tiny though, it took me 15 minutes to visit all the sights near the city centre :D\\r\\nIan: Oh, whoah, that is small. How do you find it? Aren't you bored then?\\r\\nFiona: Hm, not yet, but you know, I arrived here only a few days ago. So far I had one weekend to discover the city, went out once with my colleagues and housemates.\\r\\nIan: Found any nice bars, pubs? Are there any? ;)\\r\\nFiona: A few, yes :P I'm quite worried that I may visit all of them before my contract here ends, but it's not too bad.\\r\\nFiona: But when you come to visit, we really need to go to this one cafe, it's brilliant. They have the most amazing cakes.\\r\\nFiona: <file_photo>\\r\\nIan: Booked my tickets already ;)\\r\\nFiona: You're joking?\\r\\nIan: Uhm, no? Aren't you happy?\\r\\nFiona: oh my god, of course I am!!!\\r\\nIan: :)\\r\\nFiona: When are you arriving? <3 Can't wait!!!\\r\\nIan: In two weeks :)                    Fiona shares house with 10 people. The house has 3 floors and a patio. She lives in a small town, about 20 minutes by bus from city centre. Ian has already bought the flight tickets and will visit Fiona in two weeks time. Fiona wants to take Ian to a cafe which she likes very much.                  5\n4626     13611377

I am completely out of the loop when it comes to the exams and the planned school trips.\\r\\nDan: Sure, no problem. They scheduled midterms for the second week of January.\\r\\nJenny: So just before the winter break?\\r\\nDan: Exactly.\\r\\nJenny: Do they have clasess during the midterms?\\r\\nDan: No, we are supposed to drop the kids off at 11am and pick them up afterwarda at around 2pm.\\r\\nJenny: Seriously?\\r\\nDan: I know, how can they expect working parents to pull this off, right?\\r\\nJenny: I have already used my kid card at work way to many times. Bob is busy too. It's granny time again, I guess.\\r\\nDan: Same for us. I think we should discuss this during the next PTA meeting.\\r\\nJenny: Of course, we are paying for this school not only to educate but to take care of our kids when we are working.\\r\\nDan: True! And there is only one school trip ahead of us - they are going to the science museum.\\r\\nJenny: Do they need volunteers?\\r\\nDan: Fortunately, three parents already signed in for the job.\\r\\nJenny: I bet it's Jim and Melinda.\\r\\nDan: Who else?                     Dan attended the PTA meeting this week. Jenny needs some information, because she wasn't there. School scheduled midterms for the second week of January. There won't be classes during the midterms. Dan and Jenny are frustrated, because they won't be able to pick up their children.                  5\n4694     13611695                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Barbara: Hi my friend, thank you for the pics.

I've already selected it, and I can't opt out now. Did you have to study a lot, though?\\r\\nMartha: Not really. We had a great teacher. He explained things really well in class, so it was quite comprehensible :)\\r\\nLupa: I wonder who I'll get. Do you think male teachers are better?\\r\\nMartha: In business courses or overall?\\r\\nLupa: Overall.\\r\\nMartha: I don't know, it depends whether they're dreamy or not :) Just kidding! It really depends on the subject.\\r\\nLupa: Which book did you have?\\r\\nMartha: I couldn't tell you the name of it; it's all in the past and long forgotten. If I find it, I'll send you a pic.\\r\\nLupa: Ok, thanks. See you next week.\\r\\nMartha: Take care\\r\\nLupa: Oh wait, there's something I've been meaning to ask you.\\r\\nMartha: Ok\\r\\nLupa: We have to meet in person for me to explain it all. We'll talk later, bye.     Lupa will be taking Risk Management classes. Martha had it last year. It was boring, but didn't require much studying, as they had a good teacher. She can't remember the name of their book, but if she can find it, she'll send Lupa a picture. Lupa needs to talk to Martha in person about something.                  5\n4899     13814268

Probably will finish by midday and from then on nothing too urgent.\\r\\nMark: I don't know how to tell you this, but I was supposed to have the next day off so I planned to finish all urgent tasks tomorrow.\\r\\nMr. Benson: Mark, can you cancel the day off? We really need your help here.\\r\\nMark: That's not really that important. I just need to make a few phone calls. When will you be back, Mr. Benson?\\r\\nMr. Benson: On Tuesday. Thank you, Mark. \\r\\nMark: Can I have Wednesday or Thursday off then? \\r\\nMr. Benson: Of course. I'll tell Lona later to book both days for you. One is on the company.\\r\\nMark: Thank you, sir. I'll be right back. \\r\\nMr. Benson: All right. Claudia - Since you have the smallest workload I want you to call all out major clients and ask them about client satisfaction. Lona has the survey, so ask her for it. \\r\\nClaudia: Of course. \\r\\nMr. Benson: You don't have much time, because I'll need the processed data by 11.\\r\\nClaudia: You'll have it on your e-mail by 10:30.\\r\\nMark: I'm back.\\r\\nMr. Benson: Thank you, Claudia. Andy - I need you to prepare a presentation on our company. Something for laymen, not too complicated and not too specialised. A lot of positive figures.\\r\\nAndy: No problem, sir. Do you need any specific data?\\r\\nMr. Benson: Financial, social and something intangible. \\r\\nAndy: By when do you need it?\\r\\nMr. Benson: By the end of the day. \\r\\nAndy: Will do. \\r\\nMr. Benson: Thank you, Andy. Mark - you get the hardest task. I want you to do some data mining.\\r\\nMark: Data mining? What am I looking for?\\r\\nMr. Benson: I want you to pull everything you can find on our clients' financial situation before the agreement with us, one month after signing and their current standing. \\r\\nMark: That's a lot of work. I don't know if that's doable in one day. \\r\\nMr. Benson: I'm sure you can manage. \\r\\nMark: And when do you need it?\\r\\nMr. Benson: Like Andy's presentation - by the end of the day.\\r\\nMr. Benson: Since everyone knows what to do, let's make it work!

Chloe and Henry's boss has already sent Chloe several reminders.                   5\n5450     13814304                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Lisa: Hi, what’s up?\\r\\nTom: I’m doing fine, I’m a bit stressed because of the holidays.\\r\\nLisa: Why, what’s wrong, I’d thought you should be happy.\\r\\nTom: Nope. It gives me goose bumps. \\r\\nLisa: Man, what’s sooo wrong about Christmas? \\r\\nTom: Everything, if you want to know my opinion.\\r\\nLisa: Really? Just think about it, Christmas, family, delicious food, gifts… \\r\\nTom: Yeah, gifts. I hate buying gifts for everyone. \\r\\nLisa: oh, c’mon, you shouldn’t worry too much. \\r\\nTom: I’ve got no idea what to buy!\\r\\nLisa: O, give me a break.. just buy some sweets, maybe chocolate Santa;-)\\r\\nTom: No, I don’t wanna do it. Everybody’s trying to lose weight in my family;-)\\r\\nLisa: Oh, I bet they will;-) Right for the Christmas season… \\r\\nTom: It’s not funny. You know?\\r\\nLisa: OK, so buy just one gift for everyone.\\r\\nTom: Like what???\\r\\nLisa: I’ve got an idea.

devastated\\r\\nAlex: oh god\\r\\nMegan: they will try to reconstruct it\\r\\nMegan: but now they have to stabilize his state\\r\\nAlex: of course, they can't do anything about it as long as he's dying\\r\\nMegan: sad\\r\\nAlex: keep my updated about the poor guy\\r\\nMegan: ok, I will\\r\\nMegan: there is a lot of journalist here anyway\\r\\nMegan: but they decided not to inform them for now\\r\\nAlex: I see.                  In the shooting on Staten Island a policeman was wounded by friendly fire. He was brought to the Intensive Care Unit of Alex's hospital. Megan's friend who works there says he's in a bad state. Megan will keep Alex updated about him. There's a lot of journalists around the hospital.                   5\n5661     13729425                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Jo: Hi Tabs, you ok, girl ?\\r\\nTabitha: Hey babes! I was just thinking of you! How's the wedding planning coming on?\\r\\nJo: Well, I've got 8 weeks left, can't wait for it to be over so I can relax!\\r\\nTabitha: How are the numbers? Everyone replied?\\r\\nJo: No, that's one of the issues, still 20 or so not replied/ unsure! Can't plan the seating etc yet, annoying! 😠\\r\\nTabitha: They surely should reply in the New Year, may have to chase them up, do people do that?\\r\\nJo: I don't know! I'm such a newbie to all this! Course, Finn is really laid back about it all!\\r\\nTabitha: That's men for you! How about the hen weekend, what's planned, did you decide?\\r\\nJo: Yeah, more or less, my sister thought about Paris for 2 nights, love the idea!\\r\\nTabitha: Sounds great, but isn't it expensive?\\r\\nJo: Well, if I can book 10 of us, then it's only £300 each, not too bad, but the hotel is out of the way a bit, sis can navigate, though.\\r\\nTabitha: Well, she did live there for a while, didn't she, that's useful! I think I could scrape together 300 and it does sound lovely, we getting there on Eurostar?\\r\\nJo: Yep! I hope to finalise the details in the next week and I'll bring you up to speed then. \\r\\nTabitha: Is your Mum going?\\r\\nJo: Yes, she loves a good time, and my Auntie Jan is coming too, she is ace! Hope the oldies don't cramp our style, though!\\r\\nTabitha: Well, we can't go totally nuts in Paris, I bet they already think of us as rowdy English drunks!\\r\\nJo: Bugger! Hadn't thought of that!

Trudy but it's not really my thing                                                                                                                  Carmen watches TV and do yoga to relax. Trudy smokes weed for the same reason. Kian complains she is very stressed lately, she needs holidays. Trudy invites her for a joint. Kian renounces.                  5\n5946     13864832

Long time, no see! You alright, man?\\r\\nJohn: Hamish!! What a blast from the past! It must be at least 20 years.\\r\\nHamish: More like 25, mate, back when we both had hair😄\\r\\nJohn: Ah, you've seen my Facebook pics, then?\\r\\nHamish: Oh yes, right little stalker I am! You still with Ferguson's?\\r\\nJohn: Nah, moved on about 15 years ago, now, live in Nottingham now too.\\r\\nHamish: Ah, exciting place! 😃 Makes Hull look like a happening city!\\r\\nJohn: No, you're still miserable buggers up there, look at Philip Larkin, Paul Heaton etc!\\r\\nHamish: Point taken, but who actually comes from Nottingham?\\r\\nJohn: Mmm, not sure, D H Lawrence perhaps, will have to check and get back to you. How's the missus?\\r\\nHamish: Anna's great, still at the Uni. We've actually got 4 kids now too!\\r\\nJohn: Bloody hell, you've been busy! Me and Zoe actually split up 10 years ago and now I'm married to Zara, we've got a 3 year old called Spike.\\r\\nHamish: You're kidding? Thought you and Zoe were set for life after Uni, can't believe it. Spike, eh, umm, interesting!\\r\\nJohn: He's actually called Stefan, but for some unknown reason, he's known as Spike. We like it, it's wacky!\\r\\nHamish: You always did have an odd sense of humour! Still at the charity?\\r\\nJohn: No, moved on, like you. I run a homeless shelter in the town, love my job😍\\r\\nHamish: Great! Fancy meeting one weekend, catch up etc?\\r\\nJohn: Well, weekends are super busy, maybe if I can get some cover I can manage. Will get back to you.\\r\\nHamish: Brilliant! Get back to me asap, we can sort something out!\\r\\nJohn: Yes! Looking forward to it.

How was it?\\r\\nHeidi: It felt like I woke up from a coma.\\r\\nDarrell: hehe\\r\\nHeidi: Yeah, really weird. Have you moved to lublanska yet?\\r\\nDarrell: Yeah, we moved. It sucks now, it's so far.\\r\\nHeidi: Yeah, but now we work so close to each other.\\r\\nDarrell: That's about the only positive. You know it takes me an 1h 20m to get here. That's over 2.5 h for commuting.\\r\\nHeidi: Maybe you should consider taking your car.\\r\\nDarrell: Maybe, but it burns so much.\\r\\nHeidi: Get a new car! The newer cars burn like 5 nowadays.\\r\\nDarrell: Yeah, I'd love to, but no moollah!\\r\\nHeidi: I know what you mean. Everything keeps going up except our salaries.\\r\\nDarrell: Tell me about it. All my fav. restaurants jacked up their prices.\\r\\nHeidi: Speaking of which, let's have lunch? :)\\r\\nDarrell: Ok. See you at 12:30      Heidi came back.

But how have you been? How has Berlin treated you?\\r\\nThomas: No worries. Well, I was so happy to get funding for this trip in the first place. Last months were hell because I was finishing the thesis and I was craving to leave Madrid and have a break from Sultana for a while.\\r\\nDella: And what are you actually doing in Berlin? I mean, after having submitted?\\r\\nThomas: Well well well, I requested this mostly because I wanted to escape reality. I don't even want to remember how I justified the funding request\\r\\nDella: Lol That's fine by me. I forgot when the defense was supposed to be. Sorry...\\r\\nThomas: You're on total leave from reality I see\\r\\nDella: Yes! And I won't even bother remembering how I justified it lol\\r\\nThomas: Ha ha ha\\r\\nDella: But seriously, when is the defense?\\r\\nThomas: Well, it's actually next week. So you might be unable to attend...\\r\\nDella: Oh fuck me!!! So sorry\\r\\nThomas: Nah, it's ok. After these few weeks in Berlin I'm not even taking this so seriously\\r\\nDella: I'm glad.

How much do they pay?\\r\\nClaire: I don't know yet, I haven't asked because it's in Swansea :/\\r\\nTom: oh damn\\r\\nClaire: yeah, my thoughts exactly\\r\\nTom: so what are you thinking?\\r\\nClaire: I don't know, I asked the recruiter if they have an opening in London or just a different big city\\r\\nClaire: I don't want to move to Swansea...\\r\\nTom: but the job's cool, it sounds perfect for you\\r\\nClaire: I know :(((\\r\\nClaire: He said they don't have anything in London, just Swansea\\r\\nClaire: i don't get why they do this\\r\\nTom: it's good that they're interested in your profile\\r\\nClaire: yes, but why no one's from London... I got a lot of offers from Ireland as well\\r\\nTom: eh, but don't you want to give it a go?\\r\\nClaire: I was thinking about it, but... no, if I were a fresh graduate then maybe, but now it's kind of pointless                                                       Claire got a job offer for a Paid social manager. They work with the fashion industry, so it's interesting for Claire. However, it's in Swansea. She would prefer something in London or another big city. She's also getting many offers from Ireland.                  5\n6039     13812552                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Laura: let's move here, ok?\\r\\nJosh: sure!

Carmen will text Mike.                  5\n6571     13729109                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Rod: Hi Man, you OK?\\r\\nRich: Not too bad, family Ok?\\r\\nRod: Yeah, Carrie's gone back to work now, things are a bit more hectic.\\r\\nRich: Where's the little 'un now?\\r\\nRod: My parents have got him 3 days, child minder for 2.\\r\\nRich: That sounds like a logistical nightmare! \\r\\nRod: Not really, I drop him off at mum and dad's with all the gear, then Carrie does the child minder drop off, not too bad so far!\\r\\nRich: You seen Gary round lately?\\r\\nRod: He moved to London I think. He's a chef now, so I hear. Can you imagine?\\r\\nRich: Christ! I don't fancy eating anything he cooked! His hygiene standards were pretty grim, remember his flat?\\r\\nRod:: Bloody hell, yes! There was hardly any room to even sit down and the whole place was stinking!\\r\\nRich: Remember that gorgeous French girlfriend he had, Christa, wasn't it, what did she see in him?

procedural reasons only\\r\\nTeresa: what?\\r\\nAlphonse: he claimed you missed the deadline\\r\\nMolly: oh, no, it must have been just few minutes after midnight \\r\\nAlphonse: yes, maybe, but they have to obey the rules.\\r\\nTeresa: Alphonse, you'll be there?\\r\\nAlphonse: I will, I present a paper on Friday\\r\\nTeresa: Great, let's hang out Friday evening\\r\\nAlphonse: yes!

I dont use fb or messenger on my phone anymore. Sorry! BUT YES.. Hereditary\\r\\nLinda: What did you think?\\r\\nAndrei: Is amazing...we caught it one rainy weekend at the cinema and loved it...I loved the little things, like that she created those claustrophobic doll houses that kind of made everything you were watching more unnerving...\\r\\nLinda: I knew you'd love it! It broke so many horror trope rules, you were never sure what was going to happen next. And the dolls - sometimes you couldn't be sure if you were looking at the real thing or a miniature set. Very very cool!\\r\\nAndrei: Hope you guys are going fabulously up there. We should be up there soon and will have to catch up and see your place.. xx\\r\\nLinda: We are settling in well. Moved almost everything up from Ballina yesterday - nearly killed us. Been looking at property too. Found a great place up at...Terania Creek! Which is where Duncan lives! Spoke to him this afternoon about the area. That would be pretty funny if we ended up as neighbours 🤔😀\\r\\nAndrei: Oh my god...How funny...I sent Duncs a message on here just before I replied to you...and I’ve woken up this morning to a reply from him saying that he had a lovely chat to you about the property across from him...How freaky. 😲 We all must have been in each other’s orbit yesterday \\r\\nLinda: Yeah the coincidence is actually amazing\\r\\nAndrei: will confirm dates when we know for sure we can both get up there. 😘\\r\\nLinda: Had Sammy and Ruth over for dinner last night. Ruth was asking after you both, says she never gets a chance to catch up. So when you do come I'll organise a bbq, dinner or lunch at ours if that's agreeable. You'll love Sammy\\r\\nAndrei: Sounds delightful... I love Ruth.. And miss her terribly..

How many ppl are we inviting?\\r\\nTerry: You, me, Johnny and Sheila, Julie, Robert, Sarah and Ruth, Stinky Steven..\\r\\nKaren: Really? Are we inviting Stinky Steven to the party? Isn't it a bit of a social suicide? XD\\r\\nTerry: Travis likes him and come on, he doesn't smell that badly XD\\r\\nKaren: When you keep the windows open he doesn't…  Have you checked if Cute Barber is still available?\\r\\nTerry: I did this and even more!

Do not ask me how :D\\r\\nKaren: You're on fire Terry!  Have you also bought the gift?\\r\\nTerry: I didn't have time to go to the shop, I just talked to Sheila and John about it. They live closer so they can buy it anytime\\r\\nKaren: What do they think about it? Is it a good idea?\\r\\nTerry: They agree, he should be happy with a new drone, especially when he lost his in this stupid accident\\r\\nKaren: So it seems we are set. What time should we start?\\r\\nTerry: Travis ends job at 5, he shoud be in the pub around 5.30\\r\\nKaren: What did you tell him? I hope it was something  believable XD\\r\\nTerry: I told him that I got promoted so it would be a celebration evening :D\\r\\nKaren: LOL, so NOT believable!

Travis thinks they are celebrating Terry's promotion.                   5\n7046     13829245                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Lonya: <file_photo>\\r\\nLonya: We are fine and as you can see as touristy as possible. Horrible! Not possible otherwise.\\r\\nKitty: But it's perfectly alright. Why horrible?\\r\\nKitty: You both look happy, relaxed, bronzed, healthy... What more do you want?\\r\\nLonya: And we are. But you are always in a crowd of foreigners. Taking the same pictures. Buying the same things. Going to the same restaurants... So predictable! So artificial...\\r\\nLonya: In one respect we are different: we hardly ever take selfies! Just look at her:\\r\\nLonya: <file_photo>\\r\\nLonya: And she went on like this for half an hour or so. Oblivious to her surroundings. She probably didn't even know where she was!\\r\\nKitty: And where was she?\\r\\nLonya: Tulum temple on the Riviera Maya. Every structure rebuilt for tourists like her. Nothing here is authentic.\\r\\nLonya: <file_photo>\\r\\nLonya: This side is in its original condition. Can you see what I mean?\\r\\nKitty: Yes, I do but would't hold it against them. At least you can see in the reconstruction what these temples looked like. Otherwise you'd be visiting only heaps of rubble.\\r\\nKitty: Of course we have in Europe a different attitude to ancient monuments but who knows? Maybe Mexicans are right and not we?\\r\\nLonya: I'm not sure. I'll think about it.\\r\\nLonya: Maybe what I object most to is the fact that they don't explicitly say it's reconstruction. Seeing my first Maya temple I was in raptures until Thomas showed me those that haven't been reconstructed and explained the idea behind it.\\r\\nKitty: Oh stop it Lonya! Just enjoy your holidays and stop philosophizing. \\r\\nLonya: You are probably right.\\r\\nLonya: It's not that much left of it. 10 more days. Somehow pity but I'm also looking forward to being back at home.\\r\\nLonya: Then we'll talk about it again.\\r\\nKitty: Enjoy as long as it lasts!                                                           Lonya's having holidays. She doesn't like the fact that every foreigner does the same activities. Most of the structures there are reconstructed. Lonya objects to the fact that it's not explicitly said. Lonya is staying there for 10 more days.                  5\n7047     13716217                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Jessica: Hey everyone, reminder: Thanksgiving at our place starts at 2 :) \\r\\nDavid: and don't be late!

mate!\\r\\nTom: Been struggling with the damn pump all day.\\r\\nHank: Damn!\\r\\nTom: Yeah and I'm still no closer to a solution.\\r\\nHank: What's been going on with it?\\r\\nTom: It kinda works and pumps the water out but it doesn't produce enough power to pump it out through the hose.\\r\\nHank: Air bubbles?\\r\\nTom: Yeah, I thought that too but I'm not so sure now.\\r\\nHank: Have you tried throwing it into the pond and wiggling it around to see if you can dislodge the air bubbles.\\r\\nTom: Yeah, been there done that.\\r\\nHank: And...\\r\\nTom: Seems to work for a moment then you put it back in the sump and we're back to square one.\\r\\nTom: I thought of taking it apart to see if maybe the turbine needs cleaning out.\\r\\nHank: If you can help it please don't do that as it might invalidate the warranty.\\r\\nTom: Might need to do that because I think I've exhausted every other option.\\r\\nHank: Wait until I come home and I'll see if I can manage to get it going.\\r\\nTom: OK.\\r\\nHank: I'll be home by 7pm.                                                                                                                 Tom's pump doesn't work properly. It sucks the water in but pumps out just the air bubbles. Nothing helps. The pump is still on warranty. Hank will be home at 7 pm and will check the pump.                   5\n7088     13829615

quite well, and they are good for the economy\\nHenning: so she seems to have saved us from Nazis\\nTobias: I believe she's generally a good person\\nEmmanuel: And she believes in the EU\\nEmmanuel: what is so needed now\\nTheresa: true, but who will come next?\\nHenning: this is a big question\\nHenning: there is a successor in her party\\nHenning: but I don't know if the woman will gain

We got here about 3ish, just chilling out, watching TV, will go for a walk later.\\r\\nRob: You all fancy pizza for tonight?\\r\\nSteve: Hmm, not sure, I'll ask everyone.\\r\\nRob: OK.\\r\\nSteve: Well, Mum would like fish and chips, Karen wants a Chinese meal and me and the kids are fine with pizza.\\r\\nRob: OK, that's awkward! Can you persuade Mum or Karen to change their mind, I really don't want to go to 3 places!\\r\\nSteve: Just asked, Karen says pizza is far too carby and thinks Chinese is better in that respect, Mum doesn't like pizza much but could stand some Chinese food.\\r\\nRob: We have a very difficult family! Ok, I'll stop at the 2 places. Right, what about orders?\\r\\nSteve: Right, me and Danny like pepperoni, Suki wants a chicken and bbq sauce pizza, Mum wants lemon chicken and special fried rice, Karen wants chicken with mushrooms, spicy veg and plain rice.\\r\\nRob: OK, sounds clear enough. Now, what time do you want to eat?\\r\\nSteve: About 6/6.30?\\r\\nRob: Right, I'll ring and go get it at 5.45ish. Oh, just remembered, the pizza place delivers so I only have to visit the Chinese place! Got any wine or other drinks?\\r\\nSteve: Umm, no, actually. Could you get a couple of bottles of white wine and some sugar free squash or pop for the kids?\\r\\nRob: Well, that means I still have to go to 2 places! Can't you or Karen go?\\r\\nSteve: Oh, well, we've already had a couple of beers each, it is the Christmas hols, you know!🎄😁\\r\\nRob: I suppose I have to stop and get the drinks too, then 😒. Some bloody relaxing holiday for me!\\r\\nSteve: Don't be arsey, you only see us all a few times a year! Look, how about you and me popping down the pub tomorrow?\\r\\nRob: Maybe, but you can pay your rounds this time!\\r\\nSteve: Well, I had no cash on me at Easter! Only a one-off!\\r\\nRob: It'd better be! Make sure you go to the cash point before we go out tomorrow! Oh, and I will want you or Karen to pay your share of the take away this time!!!!\\r\\nSteve: Don't get stressed, bro!

15 pages of notes.\\r\\nFrank: Everything else 1-2 pages of notes per project.\\r\\nFrank: Naturally I started from the biggest one. :D\\r\\nJosh: Who wouldn't?\\r\\nFrank: Anyhow, I like how ze zing will compose my project into proper novel form when I'm finished.\\r\\nFrank: Also it seems to have GREAT script-writing tools.\\r\\nFrank: So when I finally get to the movie project, it'll be easier to do.\\r\\nJosh: The only question that remains is where to find the time to do all this?\\r\\nFrank: I'll cut down my Desktop Dungeons time 50% and I should have enough time to finish a book per month. :D\\r\\nFrank: I realized that I waste a ton of time playing some pointless flash games, etc.\\r\\nFrank: Although Desktop Dungeons is a \"proper\" game. :D\\r\\nFrank: Difficult as fuck but fun!\\r\\nJosh: Objection! Playing games is not a waste of time! :P                                            Neither Frank nor Josh read the manuals before working with a new software. Frank has a few book projects drafted. Both Frank and Josh play computer games. Frank wants to limit gaming in favour of writing. Josh doesn't think playing games is a waste of time.                  5\n7513     13865085

I don't think it changes anything.\\r\\nDaniel: In order to apply for an internal transfer, I need to have my manager's permission and my manager... well, he's kind of a dick.\\r\\nKaren: Are you under Tom Smith?\\r\\nDaniel: Yup, one and only\\r\\nKaren: Hm, he can be difficult true, but do you really think he won't let you transfer?\\r\\nDaniel: I'm more than sure he won't. I'm kind of stuck because of him. That's why I wanted to talk with someone from HR, you know, directly, someone who won't spread the rumour\\r\\nKaren: I get it. I knew a girl, Patricia, from HR and I think she'll be happy to help.\\r\\nDaniel: That's great! This is quite a delicate issue. I'd love to change the department, try something different\\r\\nKaren: Understandable.

I think I won't be able to get out of bed today. Could you let prof. Simons know that I am sick?\\r\\nAmelia: Sure! You're sure it's the flu? Most people who think they have the flu usually just have a cold. \\r\\nJack: I don't know. I have sore throat, and sneezing.\\r\\nAmelia: With the flu you would run a high fever.\\r\\nJack: Luckily, I don't have it.\\r\\nAmelia: When did it start? Symptoms of the flu tend to come on abruptly.\\r\\nJack: Hmm, actually I've been feeling bad for a few days. Today it became much worse.\\r\\nAmelia: I think it's just a cold. What doesn't change the fact that you should stay home.\\r\\nJack: I think so.\\r\\nAmelia: I think you work too much. You need some rest. Possibly, your organism is rebelling against your workaholism.\\r\\nJack: Haha, that may be true. It's embarrassing that even you noticed it.\\r\\nAmelia: Sure Jack, everybody can see it. You're way too serious about the stuff.\\r\\nJack: I'll think about it. Thanks. \\r\\nAmelia: No problem. And don't worry about prof.

I think it was awful really\\r\\nRobert: That bad? but they serve pizza\\r\\nJessica: Their problem is that they serve everything. They have pizza and kebab and some Thai and Chinese\\r\\nRobert: Hm, it does sound weird. I just saw that they have pizza\\r\\nJessica: Probably the owners couldn't agree on the cuisine. I don't know, but the result is awful\\r\\nJessica: I went there with Mary and basically nothing was good. I had a pepperoni pizza and a drink, she ordered something Thai, I don't know what it was, but she said it was terrible\\r\\nRobert: Eh, I was hoping that maybe we have a decent restaurant nearby, at last!\\r\\nJessica: Don't you like La Toscana?\\r\\nRobert: I do, but it's just one restaurant in the neighbourhood. I love pizza but not that much\\r\\nJessica: Ok, I get it. I don't mind as for me Italian cuisine is the best cuisine in the world ;)\\r\\nRobert: It's great, but it's quite surprising that there's no Chinese or Vietnamese nearby\\r\\nJessica: You sure? I think Greg was telling me he's ordering his favourite nems and he doesn't live that far away from us\\r\\nRobert: Interesting... I need to talk to him then, I googled for restaurants with delivery but nothing came up\\r\\nJessica: Maybe they don't have a website? Or didn't pay Google to advertise them? I don't know how it works\\r\\nRobert: Hm, maybe, thanks Jess! I was really close to inviting Gemma to that new place\\r\\nJessica: For a date? Oh my, that'd have been disaster                     A new restaurant opened down the street. It serves everything: pizza and kebab and some Thai and Chinese. Jessica and Mary went there last week, but the food was not good. Robert nearly invited Gemma to a date there. He is not a great fan of Italian cuisine, but Jessica loves it.                   5\n8387     13729882                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Tim: Happy birthday mate!\\r\\nJim: Thanks. :-)\\r\\nJim: You coming to the party?\\r\\nTim: I'd love to but I have responsibilities.. Meh!\\r\\nJim: Stuck babysitting your little sister again?\\r\\nTim: How did you guess? LOL\\r\\nJim: Cause you're always bailing out on events lately and it is always your little sister... \\r\\nTim: Hehe... \\r\\nTim: If I don't babysit her my parents will kill me.\\r\\nJim: How old is she again? 12?\\r\\nTim: 13\\r\\nJim: Old enough to stay home alone then.\\r\\nTim: That's not what my folks think or say.\\r\\nJim: But your folks are dicks.\\r\\nTim: Yeah I know. I can't wait to finally have enough cash to move out of home.\\r\\nJim: Do it!\\r\\nJim: It's not easy but at least you have your freedom.\\r\\nTim: I don't have the money though.\\r\\nJim: You can always move in with us.                    It's Jim's birthday. Tim is not coming to the party as he has to babysit hist 13-year-old little sister. Tim is missing events lately, because he has to do this. Tim's parents don't think Tim's sister is old enough to stay home alone. Tim would move out, but doesn't have the money.                  5\n8412     13730028

was inappropriate of him. Jean would like to know what Joan decides. Joan feels overwhelmed and doesn't want to decide at all. Joan's past decisions left her broken-hearted. Jean feels the same way.                  5\n8429     13727966                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Flora: too hot for the beach... see you tomorrow\\r\\nGranny: the same for us, even inside\\r\\nFlora: i'm in transit in Amsterdam, i'm leaving in one hour.

Granny will arrive for a lunch with Flora.                  5\n8454     13611524                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Catherine: Have you seen Anabelle on facebook recently? I guess it's about a month that I haven't seen her\\r\\nMary: geez you're right. What do you think about it?\\r\\nCatherine: I'm afraid she's got some problems again...I don't want to call her cause you know how it ends...the same as always\\r\\nMary: yeah I know. but maybe we should text someone who knows her? like a sister or any other friend\\r\\nCatherine: yeah, I guess that's a good idea\\r\\nMary: I hate when she disappears like that. I just can't hold my nerves.\\r\\nCatherine: I understand you, but you know very well how her mind works. She rarely thinks logically when she is in these states of mind.\\r\\nMary: I know...maybe it's too difficult for me to process cause I'm always balanced...\\r\\nCatherine: I texted Adrianne and waiting for her to respond\\r\\nMary: ok\\r\\nCatherine: She says Anabelle needs some time for herself, but she's home and everything's allright\\r\\nMary: thank god...I hope we'll se each other soon\\r\\nCatherine: for sure, it's only two weeks left and we're back at the university.\\r\\nMary: btw, they could finally upload this timetable...I got many other things to do and organise, how can they keep us unaware for such a long time\\r\\nCatherine: they can, as always...but I'm sure we won't have too many classes and Mondays will be free, as they used to.\\r\\nMary: at least that.\\r\\nCatherine: yep.                                                          Catherine hasn't seen Anabelle on Facebook since a month. She's afraid she's having problems again. Catherine texted Adrianne about it. She said everything's alright with Anabelle. Mary and Catherine are going back to the university in 2 weeks.                  5\n8476     13828016                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Nora: Dear Tracy and Ian, how are you doing? Where are you now? Haven't heard from you for quite a while!\\r\\nTracy: My lovely Nora, don't worry about us! We've been staying in a resort of Riviera Maya, eastern side of Yucatan, for 3 day now. Recuperating from those 4 weeks of driving all over the peninsula. Sorry for not contacting you immediately :$\\r\\nNora: Good! Have a good rest. What's it like in your new place?\\r\\nTracy: Cannot complain!!!\\r\\nTracy: <file_photo>\\r\\nNora: Oh my gosh! That looks bloody luxurious!! I'm green with envy!\\r\\nTracy: I'm afraid it is. As luxurious as they get, resorts here, but we're staying in a mid-range suite here in Vidanta. All thanks to Ian's time-share membership.\\r\\nNora: Is it this Hapimag?\\r\\nTracy: No, Hapimag is only Europe. This one is RCI, an American thing, I believe.\\r\\nTracy: <file_photo>\\r\\nNora: You happy devil!! But surely all that sunshine and seawater has been playing havoc with your skin =3\\r\\nTracy: Afraid it has :-( But I don't care. We both feel very fit, well rested and full of fantastic impressions. And enjoying all this beauty and luxury. And probably eating and drinking too much.\\r\\nNora: How long are you staying there?\\r\\nTracy: Altogether 2 weeks in Vidanta. Then a flight to Cuba for 4 weeks, then back to Mexico.\\r\\nNora: Keep me posted!\\r\\nTracy: I will. Love to you and Pete from us!\\r\\nNora: XXX                              Tracy and Ian are settling in Vidanta, Yucatan after a four-week drive. They are staying here two weeks. The resort is rather luxurious but they are staying in a mid-range suite. They enjoy the views and relax.

talked to a naval officer today\\nFlora: and even they are not sure, but this used to be a popular road to the Canary Islands\\nAngus: Yes, this is what I read\\nDaphne: for gods sake, Canaries are about 1800km from there\\nArlo: correct, it's insane\\nArlo: what makes the whole thing even more tragic\\nFrederic: Did anybody survive?\\nArlo: not even a body was found\\nArlo: just the boat\\nFlora: but it's really a mess here, the situation is getting worse\\nArlo: and the humanitarian aid?\\nFlora: you know my opinion on NGOs, sometimes I think they only make a situation worse\\nArlo: I know, I saw it in Haiti\\nFlora: but here it's maybe even worse, Guinea-Bissau became the main point of drug smuggling from Latin America\\nFlora: at least it seems so\\nArlo: i know, miserable and hopeless...                                              There was a boat found off Guinea-Bissau coast. There are no survivors. Flora talked to a naval officer today. Angus read they wanted to get to the Canary Islands, 1800 km away. Guinea-Bissau became the principal route of drug smuggling from Latin America.                  5\n8707     13680866                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Ralph: Hi there!

Why? 😱\\r\\nTobias: So I’ve just read there’s this strike no one has told us about\\r\\nTobias: I’m a little angry to say the least. It seems to have popped out from fuck knows where\\r\\nVeronica: You’re right. I don’t seem to recall any news about it last week\\r\\nIris: Same here. But why are we even pretending we’re surprised? It’s always like this 🤬\\r\\nTobias: Oh lol, I’m chatting with the other guys on the MA group chat and The Communist is telling me off for being a blackleg atm\\r\\nIris: 🏧\\r\\nVeronica: oh lol 🤮\\r\\nTobias: It’s not funny 😂\\r\\nTobias: I hate the fucker. Will get back to you w/ more news when I’m done with him\\r\\nVeronica: Can’t wait\\r\\nIris: 🙌🙌🙌\\r\\nTobias: So… You guys have also been named. Basically every single person who refused to take part has been named, name/surname/address/your parents’ name/your pet’s name and all\\r\\nVeronica: Lmao he’s cray\\r\\nIris: AAAAAAAAAAAa\\r\\nTobias: That was well put Iris\\r\\nTobias: Frankly speaking I have no words for his dumb fuck so perhaps we should talk about your pets instead. Or your parents?!!\\r\\nIris: LOL\\r\\nVeronica: I seriously think we must talk to him or to the Professors, I can’t see how insulting people on regular basis can go on like that with no consequence\\r\\nTobias: I must tell you that at my Uni back home we’ve got a Harassment Committee. Which is not, as it might seem responsible for harassing people but rather to deal with this kind of situations in a formal and polite way\\r\\nIris: Forget about it here\\r\\nVeronica: Spain is different\\r\\nVeronica: 🤡✌️    There are no classes today due to a strike. Tobias, Iris and Veronica haven't heard about it before. People who don't take part in the strike have been mentioned by name. A member of the MA group has insulted Tobias for not participating.

The newer cars burn like 5 nowadays.\\r\\nDarrell: Yeah, I'd love to, but no moollah!\\r\\nHeidi: I know what you mean. Everything keeps going up except our salaries.\\r\\nDarrell: Tell me about it. All my fav. restaurants jacked up their prices.\\r\\nHeidi: Speaking of which, let's have lunch? :)\\r\\nDarrell: Ok.

This movie about the clergy and their scams.\\r\\nJennifer: heard of it, but haven't seen it. Have you seen it?\\r\\nCarmen: yeah, I went to the cinema yesterday with Joseph\\r\\nJennifer: and how was it?\\r\\nCarmen: it's as controversial as they say, but there is a lot of truth in it. Not in the entire film of course, but still...\\r\\nJennifer: what do you mean by controversial?\\r\\nCarmen: well...it discusses some uncomfortable matters which the clergy are often being accused of, and which some people are often trying to obscure\\r\\nJennifer: I understand...but I don't think I'll watch it, I'd rather watch something funny and pleasant instead of pissing myself off and paying for it\\r\\nCarmen: I get it, but if you change your mind, you'll not regret it. It might be a heavy piece of work but it definitely forces to rethink some matters and be more careful when it comes to the real life.\\r\\nJennifer: I'll keep your suggestion in mind. How are you, btw?\\r\\nCarmen: I'm quite ok, just chilling right now. Tomorrrow I'm going to university and later to work, I don't know how I'm gonna survive this :/\\r\\nJennifer: you will, we can meet later and chill a little bit, if you want.\\r\\nCarmen: If I won't be dead, then with pleasure. I guess we spent an evening together like ages ago :/\\r\\nJennifer: that's how being adult looks like :P no time for anything, even for sleeping\\r\\nCarmen: I think a good shopping will wake me up. Wanna go? maybe not tomorrow, but this week\\r\\nJennifer: sure, do you have anything particular in mind?\\r\\nCarmen: Well, I was thinking of a new lipstick and of some dress, as always\\r\\nJennifer: Actually I need a lipstick too, sephora?\\r\\nCarmen: might be sephora, but there are 3 other places we can visit to see what they have\\r\\nJennifer: sure, we'll see. Hm... I also need a notebook\\r\\nCarmen: a notebook?\\r\\nJennifer: yeah, like a paper one xD you won't believe it but my dog ate the old one\\r\\nCarmen: nigga what xDDDD\\r\\nJennifer: yeah, he just literally chewed it looking me in the eye\\r\\nCarmen: hell no ahahahahahahah I just died\\r\\nJennifer: yeah....just regret you haven't seen it, no vine could ever beat it xD\\r\\nCarmen: geez, I'm crying xD sorry but I couldn't stop it\\r\\nJennifer: no problem, now I'm crying too xDDD            Carmen went to the cinema with Joseph to see ''Kler''. Carmen thinks it is controversial but true and worth seeing but Jennifer prefers funny films. Carmen is going to university and then to work tomorrow. Jennifer suggests shopping later.

that.\\r\\nJohn: Yes I know. Nothing much happens until about mid January. That's why I'm asking around.\\r\\nDavid: If I hear of anything I'll let you know.\\r\\nJohn: Thanks. Keep me posted.\\r\\nDavid: I shall.                                                                           John has just left his job. John needs to find a new job quickly.

David will inform John if he hears about a job offer.                   5\n8871     13731387                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Mel: Right, it's time I bought some Christmas presents otherwise I'll be totally stressed come the holidays. You sorted yet?\\r\\nEvie: No way, I keep putting it off. You got a lot to buy?\\r\\nMel: Well yeah. My kids, the stepkids, nieces and nephews, Mum, Sis and hubby and that's just off the top of my head!\\r\\nEvie: Well, my two don't believe in Santa now and keep trying to add more stuff to their list, so that's a massive pain!\\r\\nMel: Yeah, at least when the bloody thing has been posted to the North Pole, there's no extra stuff to add. Just tell them that's that!\\r\\nEvie: Yes, you're right, I've always been too soft. Tim is much firmer than me!\\r\\nMel: Well, we've got an inspection at school on the last week of term! I feel like I'm losing my shit already but that just about tops it!\\r\\nEvie: Poor you, talk about bad timing! We had one last summer. Went OK, considering.We actually aren't Failing anymore! \\r\\nMel: Well done you! You've worked wonders at that place!\\r\\nEvie: Well, the staff do most of the work day to day, I just oversee it all.\\r\\nMel: I'm sure there's a bit more to it than that! And you've done more than your fair share at the chalk face.\\r\\nEvie: Yes, I do miss the classroom sometimes. Mind you, teaching's all I've ever done, not like you!\\r\\nMel: Well, I did enjoy the library, but the hours are so much better in school, not to mention the summer hols!\\r\\nEvie: Yeah, but everyone thinks we get home at 3.30 and just laze around. I often have meetings and admin still 6, then more stuff at home.\\r\\nMel: Well, my marking, planning and preparation take a big chunk out of every evening. I work when the kids have gone to bed most nights. \\r\\nEvie: Yes, we do our fair share, love, people who insist that teaching's a part time job just don't get it!\\r\\nMel: What do your lot want for Christmas? \\r\\nEvie: Saskia wants a new bike and Henry wants loads of space and planet themed gear.\\r\\nMel: Definitely the next Brian Cox, that lad!\\r\\nEvie: Maybe! You cooking for everyone again this year!?\\r\\nMel: I am not! My parents in law have booked Christmas lunch at The Bluebell Hotel in town, supposed to be lovely.\\r\\nEvie: My sister's offered to cook again, it was pretty grim last year; cold veg, dry turkey, greasy spuds, the lot!\\r\\nMel: Hmm, tricky! Maybe you and your mum can pitch in to help and maybe even get the men involved and you two disappear down the pub like they usually do!\\r\\nEvie: Now, that's tempting, we'll see! Anyway, see you at Christmas, I hope.\\r\\nMel: Yeah, pop round after Christmas Day if you want to, bye love!                                   Mel bought Christmas presents while Evie keeps putting it off to the last minute. They have to buy a lot of gifts for their families. Mel is busy with her teaching job too. Evie misses it. Mel's and Evie were invited to Christmas lunches, so they do not have to cook.                  5\n8883     13829736

She also gets her food there so that the dog cannot reach it.                  5\n9024     13828517                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Tom: Hi Dad, are you coming to see me next week end?\\r\\nDad: yes honey, i'm so impatient\\r\\nTom: when would you arrive?\\r\\nDad: i 'll land in Paris friday evening but  my train is only on saturday morning.\\r\\nTom: what time is your train?\\r\\nDad: i'll arrive at 11:05am at the train station\\r\\nTom: Nice.

Sounds like the French system. Only the professor merits an A\\r\\nNestor: Something like that, actually our education system is very similar\\r\\nNestor: But I didn’t even want to talk about uni!!\\r\\nAida: Ooops 🤫\\r\\nAida: On a different note… I’m polishing my Portuguese listening to Ludmilla, do you know her? 🤣\\r\\nNestor: lol yeah\\r\\nNestor: They usually play her songs at parties, etc.\\r\\nNestor: But I don’t listen to her myself\\r\\nAida: Such a shame.

A smashing hit 🥁💥\\r\\nNestor: You should tots check out Pabllo Vittar if you happen to have discovered a craving for shitty music\\r\\nNestor: He’s really “good”\\r\\nAida: Interesting\\r\\nAida: Obrigada 😻                                                            Nestor is thinking of taking History of imperialism in Latin America, Racism in Brasil, Critical Theory etc. at university. His grades aren't very good. Aida thinks Ludmila's songs are really bad. Nestor recommends listening to Pabllo Vittar.                  5\n9264     13865434                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Gina: Dear all, I’m afraid I need to bring up a difficult issue today.\\nMichael: What’s the matter, Gina?\\nGina: There has been another burglary in the neighbourhood.\\nKate: This is terrible!\\nDaniel: Where was it? This is the third one only this week!\\nGina: Fortunately no one’s been injured. They stole a tv, two laptops and a bit of cash.\\nMichael: What does the police say?\\nGina: Nothing yet, they’re investigating.\\nKate: I bet this is some kind of a gang.\\nDaniel: A gang? \\nKate: Well, no one can get a tv, laptops and all this stuff on their own.\\nGina: Regardless, I think it’d be a good thing to organise a neighbourhood watch.\\nMichael: Good thinking!\\nDaniel: Definitely. I know a friend who did this with his neighbours and it worked out pretty great.\\nKate: How did they organise it? Did they have a schedule?\\nDaniel: Well, basically, they were patrolling the streets twice a day – during the day and in the evening, always in twos.\\nGina: Could you please talk to your friend so they can help us organise it?\\nDaniel: Sure, no problem.\\nKate: I think that we can also organise a fundraising for CCTV.\\nMichael: Hm, I’m not so sure people will be keen on this. They value their privacy, you know.\\nDaniel: Well, I understand, but I kind of value my safety more.\\nGina: It wouldn’t hurt to bring this up at the next meeting. Saturday is it?\\nKate: Yes, I can talk to them. I’m not a big fan of camera either, but in this case it may be the best solution.\\nDaniel: Especially as the police is not doing their job. Three burglaries in a week is three too many in my opinion.\\nGina: It’s not an easy case, but I think CCTV may help to catch them if not to scare them away.\\nMichael: Hm, let’s wait until Saturday so we can speak to others. We can’t do anything without their approval.\\nDaniel: I’d happily suggest organising the neighbourhood watch.                                                       There has been another burglary in the neighbourhood. They stole a tv, two laptops and a bit of cash. The police are investigating. Gina, Daniel, Kate and Michael will talk about a neighbourhood watch, e.g. a CCTV, at the next meeting on Saturday.                  5\n9265     13681168                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Brenda: My car conked out on the way to work.

You're a life saver!\\r\\nChris: I am to please!\\r\\nBrenda: Thanks again.\\r\\nChris: Sure.                                              Brenda's car is broken. She will be late at work. Chris will cover for her, but only until noon, because he gas a dentist appointment. It's a busy Monday at work. There is a new person starting this day and Chris should ask them to fill out the paperwork.                   5\n9295     13612164

He has to wait for a plumber to fix a pipe in his kitchen.                  5\n9332     13681982                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Molly: My dear Rose, are you feeling better? Is Bill capable of running the house on his own? Are you currently having guests in?\\r\\nRose: Hello dear Molly, I think I'm slightly better but have to stay in bed.\\r\\nRose: Bill manages to greet guests and little else unless I specifically ask him to do something.\\r\\nMolly: It doesn't sound too good. Is he still weak after the biopsy?\\r\\nRose: Half the time he has consumed too much alcohol to be of any use.\\r\\nMolly: Do you have guests regularly?\\r\\nRose: We are booked every weekend and an odd night during the week.\\r\\nMolly: How do you manage all that?\\r\\nRose: I've a daily domestic helper on weekdays. I don't know what I would do without her.\\r\\nMolly: Is she black?\\r\\nMolly: I don't like it about Bill. He is slowly killing himself.\\r\\nRose: Yes she is. Of course he is and he doesn't care.\\r\\nMolly: Truly horrible. I feel very sorry for you Rose. And for Bill.\\r\\nRose: Well... thank you.\\r\\nMolly: I wish you plenty of strength.And now get well soon!\\r\\nRose: Thank you!                      Rose is feeling a little better but she is still bedridden. Bill was weak because he had a biopsy. He is frequently inebriated and his health is in decline. Rose and Bill entertain guests each weekend and sometimes also during the week.

You can try Aaron Waxman law firm.\\r\\nMolly: Hey. I didn't file yet for disability as I'm not applicable for short, cause I get weekly allowance from my insurance.\\r\\nDirk: Ok, no problem. I just gave you the info so you have it just in case it's denied.\\r\\nMolly: Thank you for thinking of me.\\r\\nDirk: :) In the commercial, they say they don't take any fees until you get paid.\\r\\nMolly: That's up my alley!! LOL I wouldn't have the money for it. My lawyer works that way too. So I will see if I can get my loss of wages back.\\r\\nDirk: Yeah, that's good. Anyways, keep me informed.\\r\\nMolly: Ok, no problem. This credit card debt is running a bit high.\\r\\nDirk: Take care, it'll be good, don't worry.\\r\\nMolly: I know. I have to stay strong :)\\r\\nDirk: Just take it one day at a time. Do you know when you can get back to work?\\r\\nMolly: No idea, the pain is still too much.\\r\\nDirk: Ok, just try not to worry. Talk to you later\\r\\nMolly: Thanks, take care                          Dirk has heard a law firm commercial about disability claims that might interest Molly. Molly has not yet filed a disability claim. Molly might get her loss of wages back. Molly's credit card debit is getting higher. Molly's pain is still tom much for her to get back to work.                  5\n9516     13818088

Maybe I'm not a fan of it myself but every time I pass the rink there're dozens of girls having fun\\r\\nAdam: Grrr! No way, dude. I hate winter and winter sports all the more!\\r\\nAdam: Come on guys, maybe sth else? Your suggestions've been really good so far but there appeared to be too many obstacles on the way\\r\\nMax: Bowling!\\r\\nMax: Take her to the bowling alley, fun's dead certain :D\\r\\nLogan: Max's got a point, and it's a really good one\\r\\nLogan: And don't even try to look for excuses, it's within a heated area, you can order drinks and food at the bar and they play good music in the background\\r\\nAdam: Hmm\\r\\nAdam: Actually I remember Nelly saying that she used to go bowling with friends when she was in college\\r\\nAdam: So it would be quite surprising if I took her to such a place again\\r\\nAdam: Well done, fellows. I'll give this idea a try!\\r\\nMax: Good for you, I got a feeling that she'll be delighted ;)\\r\\nLogan: Have fun, bro                                               Adam is looking for ideas for his next date with Nelly. He has already taken her to the cinema. Nelly doesn't drive so Adam doesn't want to take her go-karting. He doesn't want to go ice-skating because he hates winter sports. He likes Max's bowling idea.                  5\n9585     13829311

Some useless apps?\\r\\nVic: Good idea!\\r\\nNatty: Don't mention it :)                                                  Vic likes to play old computer game Heros sometimes. There is also mobile version of this game called War and Magic. The app is for free but there are ads. Ads can be skipped if WI-FI is turned off. Vic and Natty are downloading games for their phones.                  5\n9714     13729503                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Winnie: Hello dear, how are you?\\r\\nHilary: I'm fine, looking forward to your visit next week!\\r\\nWinnie: Well, yes, I'm afraid there's a bit of a problem with that. I've broken my leg, you see.\\r\\nHilary: Oh, you poor thing! How did it happen?\\r\\nWinnie: Well, I slipped in the shower, of all things! Bert found me on the floor, crying in pain!\\r\\nHilary: That's awful! Did you need an ambulance?\\r\\nWinnie: Yes, it was very embarrassing, me in my birthday suit with those young paramedics helping me. I did have a towel to cover my modesty a bit!\\r\\nHilary: They don't mind, they've seen all sorts of sights!\\r\\nWinnie: Thanks a lot! Well, Bert managed to get a nightie over my head with their help and off I went! I actually need morphine as it was a spiral fracture, it bloody hurt!\\r\\nHilary: I bet it did! Did you get seen to quickly?\\r\\nWinnie: Well, not immediately, but quick enough, I was past caring with the morphine kicking in, though!\\r\\nHilary: Well, I am so sorry you can't visit, we had lots of lovely things planned for you both.\\r\\nWinnie: Well, it'll take me a few months to get over this, love. Perhaps we can come up in the spring.\\r\\nHilary: That would be lovely. Look after yourself! \\r\\nWinnie: I'll try not to break the other one! Bye dear!                                                                                                                                               Winnie has broken her leg. She slipped in the shower and she needed an ambulance. She was given morphine. She can't visit Hilary. They postpone for the spring.                  5\n9727     13864397

She got it with 30% discount because she found a deal on the app.                  5\n9766     13611388                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Alex: You’re not worth my presence. Can you actually cook?\\r\\nJane: I can microwave, put a frozen pizza in the oven, cook pasta and rice (sometimes). Oh, and potatoes! You should like potatoes, you’re British.\\r\\nAlex: So you can’t cook.\\r\\nJane: I’m Kebab Princess. I don’t care about cooking. \\r\\nAlex: Kebab Peasant, you mean.\\r\\nJane: What a moron. Kebab is salad. And it makes people happy.\\r\\nAlex: Get kebab as a tattoo, please\\r\\nJane: Nono, I prefer tribal patterns. A medium-size tribal tattoo, two fingers above my bottom\\r\\nAlex: That’s called a tramp stamp\\r\\nJane: Good to know. I'll teach my children.\\r\\nAlex: You can’t cook and you’re about to get a tramp stamp. You’re not going to be a good mommy. \\r\\nJane: Ok. Pay me a compliment or else I’m breaking up with you.\\r\\nAlex: You have nice friends.\\r\\nJane: What? You didn’t…\\r\\nAlex: I tried, but there is nothing good about you, sorry.\\r\\nJane: I can carve a heart on a potato for you. Is it enough for you to love me?\\r\\nAlex: Yes, ok. We can make a deal. I want the potato and the left side of the bed.\\r\\nJane: Pfft. Forget. I don’t need your love.\\r\\nAlex: First you try to seduce me with a potato, and now you pretend you’re not needy. I don’t get you.             Alex says Jane can't cook very well, she only knows how to make basic foods. She won't be a good mummy. Jane threatens to break up with Alex, unless he tells her a compliment. Alex can only say that she has good friends, and not much else. She offers to carve a heart on a potato for Alex.                  5\n9768     13680793                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Robert: Hey, what are you up to tonight?\\r\\nSandy: I was supposed to meet up with Janet, but she cancelled on me. U?\\r\\nRobert: I was thinking about going out myself. Wanna do something fun?\\r\\nSandy: Sure. Anything particular in mind?\\r\\nRobert: Not really. You know of anything going on tonight?\\r\\nSandy: Well, there's this exhibition of modern art...\\r\\nRobert: Sorry, not a fan. Don't really get modern art. Don't know why. \\r\\nSandy: Really? I love modern art.\\r\\nRobert: How come? You don't seem the type...\\r\\nSandy: And what \"type\" likes modern art?\\r\\nRobert: You know, the geeky type...\\r\\nSandy: So, I'm a geek?\\r\\nRobert: Still, better than a nerd ;)\\r\\nSandy: LOL. Probably. \\r\\nRobert: Anything else? Maybe the movies?\\r\\nSandy: Haven't been to the cinema in a while. Anything good on at the moment?\\r\\nRobert: I'll check. Brb.\\r\\nSandy: Ok.\\r\\nRobert: Sorry to keep you waiting. There are three to choose from: horror, romantic comedy, documentary.\\r\\nSandy: Well, I'm not a fan of horrors... They scare me to death...\\r\\nRobert: That's the point, isn't it? ;)\\r\\nSandy: Maybe. Still...\\r\\nRobert: Okay then. Not the horror. The documentary? Building dams in Afghanistan. Sounds fun?\\r\\nSandy: More fun than the vampires, blood, scary creatures...\\r\\nRobert: What time do you want to go? 6:30? 7:30? 8:30?\\r\\nSandy: 7:30 is fine. \\r\\nRobert: So 7:00 at the cinema?\\r\\nSandy: Let's make it 7:15. \\r\\nRobert: Sure. See you there.\\r\\nSandy: Bye.             Robert and Sandy are planning to go out together, but Robert doesn't like modern art, although Sandy loves it. They are considering to go to the movies. Sandy doesn't like horrors. They decide to go to see a documentary about Afghanistan at 7.30. They will meet at 7.15 at the cinema.\\r\\nt                   5\n9831     13681120

Check it out, I think it's worth it and that you may be interested. \\r\\nMark: OK, thx.\\r\\nMark: But what is it? More or less.\\r\\nSusan: I found this guy on yt.\\r\\nSusan: It's about motivation, being efficient and things like that. \\r\\nSusan: We talked about it, you remember?\\r\\nMark: yep. I get it.\\r\\nMark: Thank you. I'll have a look later.\\r\\nMark: You were right, he's good!\\r\\nMark: many of the mechanisms sound familiar to me...\\r\\nSusan: :)\\r\\nSusan: I thought it might be useful :)\\r\\nMark: Yes, it is.\\r\\nMark: He does explain a lot of things. \\r\\nMark: And I've checked some other videos. There's a lot of interesting stuff.\\r\\nSusan: Which ones do you like?\\r\\nMark: <file_other>\\r\\nMark: <file_other>\\r\\nMark: And this one, but it's a longer one and I didn't have time to finish it yet.

I went to my first science event at Berkeley yesterday!\\r\\nMike: Wow :D how was it?\\r\\nAna: fantastic! I finally feel a sense of purpose of some sort. Just have to find a way to make it work in the long run...\\r\\nMike: I'm sure you will. Where are you staying?\\r\\nAna: Miracle Mile. by the Grove\\r\\nMike: Cool! How's that article coming along?\\r\\nAna: Oh, it's fine, I just need to obtain references for my masters application so I figured it might help...\\r\\nMike: I see. It's really great that you're so driven!\\r\\nAna: I try :)\\r\\nMike: So what are you gonna study?\\r\\nAna: Psychology next year, hopefully. I still need to find another professor to write me a recommendation though.\\r\\nMike: Well, I'm sure you will. I remember doing that neuroscience course with you, you were the favourite of all the lecturers :)\\r\\nAna: I guess... it's easy to be good when you're passionate about something. I'm actually planning to focus on cognitive psychology. \\r\\nMike: Have you read \"How the mind works\" by Pinker?\\r\\nAna: I have, he has a great understanding of evolutionary psychology, such a fantastic mind. Maybe one day I will be lucky enough to go to his lecture...\\r\\nMike: and he's definitely less annoying than Chomsky!\\r\\nAna: That's true... Especially since Chomsky's gone so political                                                                                      Ana is at Berkley in California. She's staying at Miracle Mile. She wants to study cognitive psychology and needs a professor to support her application. She admires Pinker. Neither her nor Mike are fans or Chomsky.                   5\n10076    13612055                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Susan: Hi Bill. I'm looking for a vacation home for August. Lila said you had some interesting ideas...\\r\\nBill: hey sis. yeah we went last year to that little place in Italy, near florence. Rented an apartment. was cheap as hell but location was not for everyone\\r\\nSusan: why so?\\r\\nBill: away from the sea. like in the very middle of the country. No beaches. \\r\\nSusan: why would you go to Italy and not have a beach?\\r\\nBill: we wanted to be away from the crowds. place had a pool and it was drivable everywhere interesing. Like a couple of hours to florence, rome, an hour to the beach if you needed to.\\r\\nSusan: pool would make up for much, true. but Italy in august?\\r\\nBill: hot as hell, but with the pool and AC it was nice. and full wine season. \\r\\nSusan: we would be going with the whole lot, the 4 of us and the dogs. do they take pets? did you take Sparky?\\r\\nBill: yup. no problem with the dogs, although you have to be careful not to let the dogs roam around the pool. they got very angry once, when we just let Sparky out and he jumped the fence. But yours are tiny. Fat, but tiny.\\r\\nSusan: cannot imagine them jumping the fence. Any fence. they have trouble to get on the couch. \\r\\nSusan: I keep telling the kids not to overfeed the dogs, but you know how they are, as soon as I turn around...\\r\\nBill: like you don't give them treats at the table :P\\r\\nSusan: shut up!\\r\\nBill: anyhoo, we drove, with sparky and the kids, much cheaper. And you need the car when you're there. It's like this little village in the middle of countryside. vinyards and olive trees. and crickets.\\r\\nSusan: drive there? how long?\\r\\nBill: two days, we drove through Germany and Austria. Made an overnight in the Alps. 8 hours to Austria then like 6 hours to the place in Italy. \\r\\nSusan: seems not that bad. \\r\\nBill: wasn't. and the place being so cheap we could afford three weeks... \\r\\nBill: it was like half the price of a hotel. We cooked ourselves or went out for dinner. nice little italian restaurants, great food. we even found a 2-star one in some little village in the middle of nowhere, can you imagine?\\r\\nSusan: oh, nice. \\r\\nSusan: It seems like a good deal. I'll talk to the hubby. send me the details, okay?\\r\\nBill: will do. phone number - they speak english, and e-mail. better to e-mail them the owner responds on the evenings, during the day he's in the field with the vines and stuff.\\r\\nSusan: great, thanks a mil!                                                                                                     Susan wants to go on vacation to Italy with her family. Bill gives her details on the cheap apartment. It's possible to take pets. Bill describes route he took. Bill will send owner's contact to Susan.                  5\n10121    13611404

We are in dire need of some new songs. We've been playing the same stuff for the past month.\\r\\nCooper: Yeah, and I even have a few cool guitar parts to show Rick.\\r\\nStan: I really wanna book a few dates this summer. I mean, I really want to start playing somewhere\\r\\nCooper: I'm itching to play, but I know I'm gonna be so nervous at our first gig.\\r\\nStan: Butterflies in your stomach?\\r\\nCooper: Something like that. But I know after the first show, I'll feel better :)\\r\\nStan: Let's focus on getting our setlist first :)\\r\\nCooper: Yeah, we still have a loooooong way to go! We only have like what 4 solid songs?\\r\\nStan: Something like that, if you don't count \"Reality check\"\\r\\nCooper: Yeah, but that's still a work in progress. Actually, I think I may have come up with a bridge for that song.\\r\\nStan: Cool, cause it's been sitting on the shelf for quite some time.\\r\\nCooper: I know. It's time we did something with it. I've got 2 new songs - \"Little steps\" and \"Rust\" I want to make them a little in the prog rock style.\\r\\nStan: You don't say?\\r\\nCooper: Yeah, lately I've grown to like some of the new prog rock stuff.\\r\\nStan: I told you it's cool. Stuff like Periphery and Disperse is great stuff.\\r\\nCooper: Maybe I'll even go to a prog rock concert with you.\\r\\nStan: Well, here's your chance. Disperse is coming in 2 weeks.\\r\\nCooper: Really? You're lying.\\r\\nStan: Seriously. I'm buying you a ticket. You can owe me back by buying me a couple lunches :)\\r\\nCooper: Ok, if you get tickets, I'm in.\\r\\nStan: Cool, talk to you later.\\r\\nCooper: Ok, see you Fri.

do\\r\\nOwen: nothing\\r\\nCarmen: why don't you try to fix it yourself?\\r\\nOwen: don't have the tools\\r\\nOwen: will call them tomorrow morning\\r\\nOwen: and see when they can have this

again. He has to replace a part. It's too late for Owen to call them. Owen will call them tomorrow morning. Owen can't fix the heating himself as he doesn't have the tools.                  5\n10158    13716112                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              James: Just got to Jesus bar if anyone is around and fancies a drink!\\r\\nPeadar: Nice, we're wrapping up here at the panto!

Had to get the truck back for a second day\\r\\nPeter: oh poop\\r\\nIan: AND we nearly didn't get anyone to help us. The guy we hired via Airtasker pulled out at the last moment\\r\\nPeter: If i were closer...\\r\\nIan: trust me, you're the first person I'd have called up!\\r\\nPeter: did you get someone in the end?\\r\\nIan: yes, but not via Airtasker. We used a local community group called the Northern Rivers Tradies' Network\\r\\nPeter: any good?\\r\\nIan: the guy or the network? He was a young guy and I think a bit dismayed at the amount of stuff we had to move. But he put his back into it and we paid him extra\\r\\nPeter: did you manage to get him for both days?\\r\\nIan: just the first. Linda and I did it alone on the second day. Talk about back breaking work. We were hobbling around for days afterwards...\\r\\nPeter: moving's never fun. But you're done now\\r\\nIan: thank god                      Ian's move was difficult. The guy they'd hired via Airtasker to help resigned at the last moment. Peter was too far to help. In the end, Ian used a man from Northern Rivers Tradies' Network on the first day, and finished the work with Linda alone on the second. It was hard work.                   5\n10318    13729458                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Pauline: Hi\\r\\nStanley: Hi sweety\\r\\nPauline: How are you?\\r\\nStanley: Working :D\\r\\nStanley: I opened my laptop and I'm working downstairs on the coach\\r\\nStanley: Better atmosphere for working :)\\r\\nStanley: <file_photo>\\r\\nPauline: I miss this cat\\r\\nStanley: And how are you?\\r\\nPauline: I was at that conference today\\r\\nPauline: And I have to tell you that it's really dissapointing\\r\\nPauline: For example the catering case\\r\\nPauline: The restaurant owners decided that they won't open and when people responsible for organization convinced them, it turned out that it's really expensive\\r\\nPauline: Moreover when the conference was coming to an end, restaurant decided that the rest of the food that they knew they won't sell anymore will be given out for free\\r\\nPauline: So imagine that you bought pricy piece of cake and coffee and suddendly 3 hours later they give out for free remaining things\\r\\nStanley: A bit unfair\\r\\nPauline: And the presentations of lecturers lasted only 20 minutes each.\\r\\nStanley: Wow. That's quick.\\r\\nPauline: Definitely too little time. In 20 minutes they won't be able to even introduce their products :/\\r\\nStanley: On the other hand, you have to know what kind of mistakes are made while organizing such events. If for example you will ever take part in organizing a conference, you will be aware of things you should avoid.\\r\\nPauline: Exactly!\\r\\nStanley: :)\\r\\nPauline: I learned few things today. I'm glad i decided to come\\r\\nStanley: I'm happy then. A bit lonely, but happy.\\r\\nPauline: Tomorrow morning, I'll be home\\r\\nStanley: I know. You'll probably wake me up :D\\r\\nPauline: Haha. And I'll force you to make me a cup of coffee.\\r\\nStanley: Haha. Ok :)                                           Stanley is working downstairs. Pauline was at the conference today and it disappointed her. There were problems with the catering and the food was expensive.The presentation only 20 minutes. Pauline learned a lot either way. She will be home tomorrow morning.                  5\n10335    13681683                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Melissa: Is there any more info on Grandma?\\r\\nRamesh: Just that she's resting comfortably.\\r\\nMelissa: That's what I heard hours ago. Did they find anything wrong/\\r\\nRamesh: We won't know for days until the labs come back. Meanwhile she's in the best place she can be.\\r\\nMelissa: Is anyone taking care of the dogs?\\r\\nRamesh: Yes, her neighbors have them so they can even go in their own yard. They are fine.\\r\\nMelissa: Phew! She's have a fit if anything happened to those dogs!\\r\\nRamesh: I know.\\r\\nMelissa: Are you going over tonight?\\r\\nRamesh: I can't; I have a work seminar and dinner after that I can't get out of.\\r\\nMelissa: Okay. I can go over tonight.\\r\\nRamesh: I'm planning on taking tomorrow off and spending most of the day.\\r\\nMelissa: That will be nice. Thanks!\\r\\nRamesh: No problem. I feel bad that I wasn't there.\\r\\nMelissa: You couldn't have known. None of us did.\\r\\nRamesh: Yes, but I usually look after her. I've just been so busy lately.\\r\\nMelissa: She doesn't blame you.

What's up\\r\\nVictoria: ha ha Well, I'm just trying to make some plans for when I'm in London. Anything in particular you'd like us to do?\\r\\nJim: Not really, we can do what you want\\r\\nVictoria: Hmm this is generous, but frankly speaking I don't have a clear idea of what I want. I've been busy with the conference stuff and will be happy to just chill.\\r\\nJim: That's more than fine as far as I'm concerned\\r\\nVictoria: Thanks. I was thinking of going to an exhibition or even to the theatre but that depends on the budget\\r\\nJim: Yeah, I know it's not the same, but I've recently discovered a cinema where all tickets cost a fiver (in Peckham). We could go see the new Harry Potter movie\\r\\nVictoria: Sure!\\r\\nJim: So that you do something basic for once\\r\\nVictoria: Ha ha, of course, I'll be delighted to\\r\\nJim: We can also go to charity shops and all the usual stuff\\r\\nVictoria: Sure, anything which is not writing a conference paper is good\\r\\nJim: Well then, I think we'll be fine\\r\\nVictoria: I look forward to seeing you. I might have to go back to work at the moment though, hope you don't mind?\\r\\nJim: No worries, it's ok. I'll talk to you tomorrow\\r\\nVictoria: Thanks! Toodles!           Victoria and Jim are making plans for their London stay. She's been busy preparing for the conference and would like to relax. They will see the new Harry Potter film in Peckham, where the tickets cost only a fiver. They can also go to charity shops. Now Victoria needs to get back to work.                   5\n10490  13729232-1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Otto: did i tell you?

It's great and all, but there are many Asian recipes and I have no idea where I could find the ingredients\\nSusan: Don't worry about this dear, just swap them with something you've got :)\\nKim: I don't think it'll work, it won't taste the same\\nJerry: That's exactly what they wrote in the book. In certain recipes you shouldn't change a thing.\\nSusan: Oh my, that's a pain\\nKim: But you're not going to use it only once for one recipe ;)\\nKim: What are you cooking?\\nJerry: I wanted to make tom yum\\nSusan: Mmmm, nice! Vegan?\\nJerry: Yes, that's the main problem ;)\\nPaul: Hi! I know a place where you can get the ingredients\\nJerry: Hi! Thank you! Could you send me an address?\\nPaul: There are many shops in Chinatown and Soho where you can find ingredients for Chinese, Vietnamese and Thai cuisine, you should also check out Japan Centre\\nPaul: <file_other>\\nKim: You'll find Korean stuff there as well! I think Indian shops should have some ingredients too, like kaffir leaves\\nSusan: So Jerry, when are you inviting us over? ;)\\nJerry: When I master Asian vegan cuisine :)\\nKim: It may take a while then\\nJerry: Thanks Kim\\nKim: What? It took my mum a lot of time to master it even though she's Korean, but good luck :D\\nPaul: I can go shopping with if you'd like, I need to buy some things as well\\nJerry: Cool! Thanks man. Is Saturday all right?\\nPaul: Sure! Anyone would like to tag along?\\nSusan: I'm all up for some exploration!                                                                     Lucy gave Jerry a cook book with vegan recipes. There are a lot of Asian recipes. Jerry wants to prepare tom yum. Paul recommends shops with Asian food in Chinatown and Soho. Paul, Jerry and Susan are going food shopping on Saturday.                  5\n10705    13730548

I almost forgot. What are we gonna see cause I forget.\\r\\nKate: Pinocchio.\\r\\nChris: Really?\\r\\nKate: I know John is a little too old, but he's still to young to see any adult plays.\\r\\nChris: He won't be happy! He's gonna say it's too babyish.\\r\\nKate: But it's a beautiful theatre. We've never been there. Plus, I'm sure everything will be very professional.\\r\\nChris: And a whole bunch of kids in the audience.\\r\\nKate: It will be ok, don't worry.\\r\\nChris: And then after that, we'll go to eat somewhere, maybe a nice Italian place. I'm paying.\\r\\nKate: Sounds good :) It's going to be really tough to make it on time. I forgot that John has his drum lessons on Sat.\\r\\nChris: Yeah, he finishes at 3. What time is the play?\\r\\nKate: 3 Oops \\r\\nChris: Hmm... maybe he can go for only half an hour.\\r\\nKate: Yeah, so he doesn't miss it completely.\\r\\nChris: We'll pick him up around 2:30 and then go straight there.\\r\\nKate: Ok. How's work?\\r\\nChris: It's really slow right now. I feel so guilty when I don't have any work to do. Everyone else is so busy.\\r\\nKate: Yeah, I'd bet it's a really uncomfortable situation. Maybe you should mention something to your manager.\\r\\nChris: I was thinking about that. But I was thinking to hold off until after Christmas. I'll see, maybe things will improve. \\r\\nKate: Ok, it's up to you. You know the situation best.\\r\\nChris: What would you do?\\r\\nKate: Well, they'll find out sooner or later. I mean, they just have to look at the logs and they'll know. It's better to come forward before they say anything.\\r\\nChris: Yeah, I know. So, you think I should mention something before Christmas?\\r\\nKate: I think so ;)\\r\\nChris: Ok.\\r\\nKate: Talk to you later. Bye.\\r\\nChris: Ok, bye.                Kate, Chris and John will see Pinocchio at the theater on Saturday. Chris thinks the play will be too childish for John. Chris and Kate will pick John up earlier from his drum lesson to make it to the play. Chris's work is going slow. Kate would mention it to his boss before Christmas.                  5\n10861    13814975

So please, talk to her!\\r\\nIan: Actually I've tried...\\r\\nGeorge: And you didn't tell me anything! \\r\\nIan: 'cause it wasn't easy :P she was quite angry\\r\\nGeorge: And don't you have any ideas what to do?\\r\\nIan: I have, but I'm afriad it won't be enough\\r\\nGeorge: Please try... maybe you'll be successful, hopefully\\r\\nIan: Ok, I'll let you know after I talk to her\\r\\nGeorge: Ok! Good luck!                                                                           Anna had an argument with Joanna so it's not easy for George to talk to her. Joanna and Anna had a common project.

Ian will let George know.                  5\n10945    13829448                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Dennis: Happy New Year! How's life? Any more travelling? Do you still see a lot of your travelling companion (I don’t think you ever mentioned his name). Or are you taking it easy in your rural idyll.\\r\\nLaura: Hello my dear Dennis! Happy New Year to you too! Am in Cuba at the moment. What a country!\\r\\nDennis: Never been there myself but it's on my itinerary. What's it like?\\r\\nLaura: A bit tough, truth to tell, but you'd like it. Abject living conditions for local people but we're in a \"touristy\" cocoon, so one easily overlooks the other side. Splendid landscapes, incredible architecture but in a more than sorry state of preservation. I love and hate to be here at the same time.\\r\\nDennis: So you aren't travelling alone, I presume.\\r\\nLaura: No, my travelling companion takes me along, so to speak, to his winter quarters, since his health doesn't cope that well with European winters. I couldn't afford these travels entirely on my own of course.\\r\\nDennis: Always thought Cuba is not expensive. Especially the post-Fidel Cuba.\\r\\nLaura: Just the contrary. In the good old days when it was supported by the Soviet Union, the living standard was not bad and they didn't have to rely on income from tourism. Then it all went down the drain, even famine and food rationing have become their daily thing. Since early 00s most not rationed goods are available only for CUC, their convertible currency. The bottom line being that whatever you buy as a tourist, you pay +/- western prices.\\r\\nDennis: So how much do you two spend daily?\\r\\nLaura: Staying in private houses about at least 100€, including food, transport and entrance fees. These days we are compelled to stay at a state-run Hotel and pay thru the nose - 130€ a night. No, Cuba is not cheap. But Havana Club YES.\\r\\nDennis: Don't like the stuff at all.\\r\\nLaura: Me neither. Gives me headaches. Even one glass of it.\\r\\nDennis: What you say will make me think twice before setting sail for Cuba.\\r\\nLaura: But it can be fantastic as well. Eg Vinales Valley in the west, with its horse-riding trips, wild camping and pure nature.\\r\\nDennis: Sounds better. I'll ask you for details.\\r\\nDennis: Anyway enjoy your trip as much as you can. Happy trails toyou two!\\r\\nLaura: Thank you, Dennis.                                                                                                                          Laura is in Cuba at the moment. She has mixed feelings about Cuba. She's travelling with her companion. Cuba is expensive for tourists. She has to spend over 100€ on a daily basis.                  5\n11006    13680269

Mary hates her Erasmus in Italy.                  5\n11155    13730053                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Olivia: i hate it that people get subborn as they grow older\\r\\nOlivia: are you busy?

Olivia didn't like it and might not go out with Josh again.                    5\n11160  13729816-1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Paul: What do you think of this new Brexit deal debacle?\\r\\nJim: She'll never get this deal through the commons.\\r\\nPaul: Probably not. But what other options are there?\\r\\nJim: at the moment there are none. I think the Tories stalled the whole process on purpose so that way they leave us with this awful deal at 2 minutes to midnight.\\r\\nPaul: Yep. That's the problem. Time is running out and if we don't say yes we'll crash out of the EU with no safety net.\\r\\nJim: Let us crash out. Anything has got to be better than staying in the EU.\\r\\nPaul: I'm not sure. The option of no-deal Brexit looks pretty scary. Some of my friends are already prepping and stockpiling food.\\r\\nJim: That's just scaremongering. Don't let them get to you. We voted out for good reasons.\\r\\nPaul: Yeah damn Remoaners. They don't know the first thing about democracy.\\r\\nJim: The Tories know that if they don't give us the deal we expected people will come out on the streets and demand it. They'll burn Westminster down if they have to.\\r\\nPaul: I think they're just testing the waters and see if they can fool us with this make believe deal which still keeps us in the EU and gives away Gibraltar.\\r\\nJim: But they won't fools us. We're onto their games.\\r\\nPaul: True.                                                She will have problems getting the Brexit deal through the House of Commons. The Tories might have stalled the process on purpose. Jim and Paul voted out of the EU. Brexit without a deal might cause problems.

I have a problem with Othello. A week ago he developed a rash and we can't get rid of it\\nDiana: <file_photo>\\nFrank: Have you been to the vet?\\nDiana: Yes, he gave us an ointment, but it didn't work\\nKaren: Hm, did you do a blood test? It doesn't look good\\nFrank: What kind of ointment?\\nDiana: Something natural, I had it made by the pharmacist\\nKaren: You should do a blood test\\nDiana: Ok, I will, the vet said it may be just a feline acne, but it should have disappeared by now\\nFrank: I think Othello may be allergic to the ointment or something completely different. Is he scratching?\\nDiana: Hm... A bit, I don't know if more than ever, he's a cat ;)\\nKaren: Frank may be right. You should run a blood test for as many allergens as you can. My friend's cat had a similar rash and was scratching itself all the time. It turned out he was allergic to chicken\\nDiana: What?! A cat?! Allergic to chicken?\\nKaren: I know, right? But he was ok after they started buying him food without any trace of chicken\\nFrank: Wow, I've never heard of something like this. Go to a different vet Diana\\nDiana: I'm afraid I need to as that one was too interested in finding out what the problem was apparently. He didn't even mention it can be an allergic reaction\\nKaren: Let us know what you'll find out!                                                             Diana's cat named Othello has had a rash for a week. The vet gave them a natural ointment which is ineffective. Karen and Frank think that Othello may be allergic to something. They advise Diana to change a vet and to do him a blood test.                     5\n11197    13828853                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Martha: I just got accepted!!!\\r\\nJay: Whaaaat!!! Congratulations! This is amazing!\\r\\nMartha: <file_photo>\\r\\nMartha: Here's my unconditional offer :)\\r\\nJay: So proud of you <3 Are then ready to go?\\r\\nMartha: I just booked my tickets, I'm flying on 12 September\\r\\nJay: That's in less than a month!\\r\\nMartha: hahaha I know, time flies\\r\\nMartha: I'm worried though because I still have no place to stay\\r\\nJay: Hm, are you looking for a flat, a room or student halls?\\r\\nMartha: Honestly? I'd take anything at this stage\\r\\nJay: Have you checked if the university has a student accommodation programme?\\r\\nMartha: Yes, they do, but it's only for full time students ;/ it's ridiculous, because I applied for the part time as I can't afford to just study, therefore I need to pay more for my accommodation. Fuck logic\\r\\nJay: Hah, seems like that, doesn't make any sense to me either\\r\\nMartha: So I'm not entitled to any accommodation programme and I'm probably at the end of the list to get a room at student halls\\r\\nJay: Maybe a private one? How expensive are the flats?\\r\\nMartha: Crazy expensive... I most probably can't afford it, but maybe it'll be possible to share with someone\\r\\nJay: I may ask around, I think I have some friends there, I can ask around, maybe they'll have a spare room\\r\\nMartha: Could you that? I'd need to stay somewhere until I can get my head around the city, uni, people...\\r\\nMartha: Oh my, I am excited, but also scared as hell...\\r\\nJay: It'll be fun, you'll see!\\r\\nMartha: It definitely would be fun if I have a place to stay\\r\\nJay: Don't be so overdramatic, it'll work out :D                                   Martha got accepted at university as part time student. She's just booked a ticket for 12th September. She doesn't have a place to stay. Flats are expensive and she doesn't have right to any accommodation program. Jay will ask around if his friends have a spare room.                  5\n11208    13611893                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Taylor: Merry Christmas!\\r\\nTaylor: May this festive season sparkle and shine and be full of true miracles, which we sometimes lack during the year 😊\\r\\nAlice: Oh, thank you Taylor!

You wouldn't believe it! We're going to make money on our apples! Producing cider!\\r\\nMama: But Sammy! Be sensible! You and Mike are teachers and not businesspeople. What sort of nonsense is it this time?\\r\\nSammy: A long story. Anyway a gay couple, good acquaintances of ours, from Dillon, are just starting a business together with a wine producer - to producer cider. It's a nice drink, tasty, healthy , cheap, and nobody has had such a glorious idea about it in our region so far.\\r\\nMama: Maybe if nobody has so far, it's not worth it?\\r\\nSammy: But everybody likes cider! The point is they'll buy our apples if we join their business. Well I don't know particulars. Yet.\\r\\nMama: Does Michael do?\\r\\nSammy: Well, he'll be meeting Oli and Natt, the gay couple, and their wine producer to discuss it all. Keep your fingers crossed please!\\r\\nMama: You and your madcap ideas!\\r\\nSammy: You aren't very supportive, mama, are you?\\r\\nMama: Oh I am! It's just that I'd be very careful in your place. Investing in a business when you can hardly spell the word... I don't know...\\r\\nSammy: But we are only investing our apples!! If the business is a flop, we'll have lost only our fruit. The money we'll put in bottles and advertising will be negligible.\\r\\nMama: Let's see. Anyway you know that about counting chicken.\\r\\nSammy: What chicken?!\\r\\nMama: Don't count your chickens before they are hatched. An adage. Old wisdom.\\r\\nSammy: :(      Teachers Sammy and Mike have decided to start producing cider. Their friends Oli and Natt, a gay couple from Dillon, are starting a business with a wine producer. They will buy Sammy and Mike's apples. Michael will have a meeting with Oli and Natt to discuss details. Mama is sceptical about it.                   5\n11296    13727909                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Jojo: Hi, Claude, ca va?\\r\\nClaude: Oui, ça va bien!

They'll go to the Museum of Broken Relationships and eat something.                  5\n11343    13612020                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Henry: hey any plans for tonight?\\r\\nLouis: hmm not really ?

Avril and Jemima will Facetime around 5.                   5\n11389    13680516                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Steve: So how did the LARP go?\\r\\nBo: That might take a while. \\r\\nSteve: I'm listening. \\r\\nBo: in general it was ok and i don't regret going, but there's a lot of things to work on. Like logistics - there was just chaos at every step before the larp - we didn't know where to go for accreditation, the organizers contradicted themselves several times\\r\\nSteve: sounds bad\\r\\nBo: and there was a several hour delay at the beginning \\r\\nSteve: not encouraging\\r\\nBo: Yeah, but once it started it got better. You have to give it to them they really put a lot of effort in the props, the set and the costumes for npcs\\r\\nSteve: any pictures?\\r\\nBo: I have several hundred actually, but I have to sift through them, so I'm just gonna upload them in a couple of days \\r\\nSteve: ok\\r\\nBo: and other players where generally good. Made a couple of friends there actually \\r\\nSteve: nice, do they larp outside their area? Maybe they could come to us sometime. We need some fresh blood. \\r\\nBo: yeah, they're definitely interested and I'm pretty sure they have no problem traveling across the country for larps. \\r\\nSteve: great to hear\\r\\nBo: yeah, anyway there was also a group of orcs - I think they all new each other beforehand - and they were getting shit-faced every night, making lewd comments to girls and generally being assholes to everyone. \\r\\nSteve: shit, did you tell the organizers? \\r\\nBo: yeah, I did, quite a few times, and they supposedly talked to them, but it didn't help at all \\r\\nSteve: too bad\\r\\nBo: if it was my larp I'll just kick them out and ban them from other events right after the first night of this shit\\r\\nSteve: totally\\r\\nBo: And that was another thing I have a problem with - the organizers just weren't assertive enough with them. If a player ruins the game for everyone else you just kick him or her out, simple as that\\r\\nSteve: You can always give them feedback about all this\\r\\nBo: I already did, cause they obviously put a lot of effort into this and just have to fix some things until next year.                               Bo went to a LARP. There were some mistakes on the organizers' part, but in general it was okay. Bo has pictures from the LARP which he will upload soon. Bo made some friends at the LARP, but a group of players was behaving badly. Bo will give feedback to the organizers.                   5\n11402    13727572                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Anna: I fucking hate my life!\\r\\nJen: What happened?\\r\\nAnna: Jim is being a dick again. He won't let me go out.\\r\\nJen: Why not?\\r\\nAnna: He says that I am always demanding and insist on getting my own away and he will not put up with it any longer.\\r\\nJen: Has he at least paid the bills and rent?\\r\\nAnna: Are you kidding. He expects me to do it cause it is my house.\\r\\nJen: But he's living there for free. You're working 3 jobs while he sits there and watches TV.\\r\\nAnna: and complains about what's for dinner.\\r\\nJen: Yeah exactly. He's a fucking parasite. Get rid of him!\\r\\nAnna: But I need him for the heavy work around the property that I can't do myself.\\r\\nJen: Like what?\\r\\nAnna: Like chopping the firewood. I can't do it on my own.\\r\\nAnna: It's the only way to heat this house and without the wood I'd freeze in winter.\\r\\nJen: So you're keeping a nasty parasite around for firewood? You gotta ask yourself is it worth it?\\r\\nAnna: Yeah I keep on asking myself this question.\\r\\nJen: You can always get a lodger.\\r\\nAnna: Not with the state of this place.\\r\\nJen: Then I really don't know what to say to you.

Anna is angry at Jim. He does not let her go out. He does not pay bills. Anna needs Jim for heavy works around the property. Jen calls Jim a parasite.                  5\n11419    13810258                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Barbara: hey! :)\\r\\nJessie: Wow, hello gorgeous! You're back!\\r\\nBarbara: Hahaha, yes, I am, but still can't believe it.\\r\\nJessie: How was it?\\r\\nBarbara: Oh Canada is beautiful <3 It's quite surreal to be back.\\r\\nJessie: I can imagine, especially going back to work ;)\\r\\nBarbara: After getting up at 9... Everyday.\\r\\nJessie: Where have you been? What have you seen?\\r\\nBarbara: We travelled all around, but spent most of our time in Montreal.\\r\\nJessie: Had a chance to visit Winnipeg? :)\\r\\nBarbara: It's a hell of a ride, but yeah! It was gorgeous, but awfully cold.\\r\\nBarbara: <file_video>\\r\\nBarbara: Snow fight in the woods.\\r\\nJessie: Omg, so jealous. How's Montreal? I was thinking about going to Canada, but it's so huge it's hard to say where to go to...\\r\\nBarbara: I would definitely recommend Montreal, it has a nice European vibe, even though you can that you're definitely not in Europe, if you know what I mean.\\r\\nJessie: Kind of. What about other cities?\\r\\nBarbara: Ottawa and Toronto are already, although I prefer Toronto. Not too keen on Quebec.\\r\\nJessie: Oh, why is that? :o\\r\\nBarbara: I don't know, maybe it's the French thing ;)\\r\\nJessie: Hahaha, I get that :D\\r\\nBarbara: But to be fair it's a nice city, maybe just not for me. I think if I'd known French, it could have been different.\\r\\nJessie: I can relate. It's been exactly the same in Paris. Loved the city, but the whole experience was a bit weird with the waiters outraged that we didn't speak French.\\r\\nBarbara: Kind of the same in Quebec then ;) Although they do have beautiful architecture and city landscape. If you have chance, go there, I'd give them another chance.\\r\\nJessie: Weren't you thinking about going to the US when you were already so close?\\r\\nBarbara: Not really, I've been to the East Coast already, so it wasn't so tempting. Maybe next year I'd venture somewhere more West... :D\\r\\nJessie: Haha, count me in for the trip to the Wild Wild West! Always wanted to see San Francisco <3                                                                  Barbara is back from Canada. She's been to Montreal and Winnipeg. Jessie would love to go there, so and Barbara recommends Ottawa and Toronto. She didn't like Quebec, though. She's thinking of going to the US next year and so is Jessie.                  5\n11423    13819180                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Dirk: Good morning!\\r\\nDirk: +- 2 weeks left, the King’s just told me that he is very amused about you guys coming.

Yes, we are both over the moon, it's been such a long time coming.\\r\\nSheila: Sure it'll be worth it, I love Barry's kids like they my own flesh and blood. And now there's the grandkids too.\\r\\nAisha: Didn't you ever want your own Sheila?\\r\\nSheila: No, not really. We didn't get together till our 40s and Barry had 3 kids already. I wasn't really bothered to be honest.\\r\\nAisha: Fair enough! Are we going out to celebrate. I thought a slap-up fish and chip supper would really hit the spot!\\r\\nSheila: Ha bloody ha! No, I fancy a nice Italian!\\r\\nAisha: Yes, that Marco at the Vesuvius is a bit of alright, isn't he! Seriously though, I'd love to go out all 4 of us again, you two are like my parents!\\r\\nSheila: God, you're full of compliments today arent you? Let's go to the Vesuvius then and us three can get nice and drunk while you sip your mineral water!\\r\\nAisha: You cruel woman! Friday, 8ish ok? \\r\\nSheila: Well, that's one of our busiest times at the chippy, not sure. How about Sunday at 2ish?\\r\\nAisha: Yes, that would be lovely. I'll ring and book as it may well be a bit busy.\\r\\nSheila: Nice one! Well, see you Sunday at the restaurant?\\r\\nAisha: Bye love!      Sheila and Barry got together in their 40s and Barry had 3 kids already. They don't have their own children, but Sheila loves Barry's kids and grandkids as if they were hers. Aisha is pregnant. They're going to go to the Vesuvius and celebrate on Sunday around 2 o'clock. Aisha will book a table.                  5\n11519    13611760                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Mike: Hi, do you have online marketing with professor Nierzwicki?\\r\\nSandra: Yes, I do.\\r\\nMike: That's great, could you help me?

I kind of new what it was all about, but I went along with you. He asked me to where something nice and he was all dressed up too.\\r\\nJen: Did you guys spend the night there? \\r\\nLorrie: Yeah, we went there Fri night and we got back today. I know Niagara Falls is a little cliché, but :)\\r\\nJen: I'm so happy for you!!! So, when's the big day??\\r\\nLorrie: We haven't decided yet. Probably spring or early summer, but I'm starting to panic already!!! The venue, dress, cake, band...\\r\\nJen: If you want I can help you plan everything!! I helped plan my sister's wedding and she said I should be a wedding planner LOL\\r\\nLorrie: That would be amazing! I need someone like you. I have no idea where to start.\\r\\nJen: Well, first you need to book the venue, and I mean like ASAP\\r\\nLorrie: I know, I know. Remember that nice place near Old Mill? I'd love to have it there.\\r\\nJen: Wouldn't we all! That place probably costs a ton! We can try if you want, though. It's good to have a few places picked out, then we'll start calling.\\r\\nLorrie: That's what they say. Can you come over tonight? I'd love to get a heads start on it.\\r\\nJen: Sure, you can tell me all the details of last night too!!\\r\\nLorrie: :) Wouldn't you like to know. Do you know where The Keg restaurant is? It's overlooking the falls. But he didn't propose there. He was very discreet about it. Actually, I was surprised that he didn't do it there until he surprised me in the hotel room.\\r\\nJen: You know Jack, always full of surprises. So, he proposed in the hotel room, did he get down on one knee?\\r\\nLorrie: Yes, but I'll tell you all about it when I come over, ok?\\r\\nJen: Ok, ok, I'll be there after dinner, probably around 6\\r\\nLorrie: Ok, I'll be waiting.

Did you enjoy it?\\r\\nBrooke: I first read The Pilgrimage and had an idea on how he writes and thinks as an author.\\r\\nBrooke: But that book you gave me, Eleven Minutes, was so different!\\r\\nSheila: He can write about anything, but one thing that stays the same is that it's always gonna be very emotional.\\r\\nBrooke: I cried while reading both of them.

significantly compared to the last season\\r\\nDylan: constant problems with sound, ads after ads\\r\\nDylan: it's just hard to watch\\r\\nEvan: I was thinking about catching a few streams this weekend\\r\\nDylan: weekends are probably your best bet\\r\\nDylan: at least you can get a match at a reasonable hour\\r\\nEvan: yeah some of the games starting hours are horrible for EU fans\\r\\nDylan: not the mention that there is 4 matches each day right now\\r\\nDylan: I went to sleep during the 2nd match yesterday and when I woke up the 4th one was still going on\\r\\nEvan: do you have any data about the viewership?\\r\\nDylan: some of the games broke 200k on twitch\\r\\nDylan: but it's the start of the season after a long break\\r\\nDylan: those numbers will most likely drop\\r\\nDylan: especially with 4 games a day\\r\\nDylan: that's just too much to follow\\r\\nEvan: 200k? not bad\\r\\nEvan: but yeah it probably won't last\\r\\nDylan: especially that the current meta is not that exciting to watch\\r\\nDylan: goats goats and some more goats\\r\\nEvan: really? nothing else?\\r\\nDylan: well they try some fun stuff from time to time like 4 dps\\r\\nDylan: but the majority of time you'll see 3 tanks + 3 supports on both sides\\r\\nEvan: that's a shame\\r\\nDylan: it will probably change with future patches but for now we're stuck with that\\r\\nEvan: alright, I'll try to catch some games to check it\\r\\nDylan: have fun... or at least try having fun ;)                                                                            Dylan watched a few OWL matches. He's not impressed, because the production value dropped. Evan wants to catch a few streams this weekend. There are 4 matches each day. The viewership fluctuates around 200000 people on Twitch.                  5\n12184    13828497

How about you?\\r\\nChris: Same - back to my mum's on Christmas Eve and then back home again on either Boxing Day or the day after.  \\r\\nSonia: I love the fact that Christmas is a family time.  \\r\\nChris: Yes me too. But after a few days I always want to run away from them! It makes me feel suffocated at times.\\r\\nSonia: True!  Think it is hard to go back home once you have left. \\r\\nChris: Never mind - this is what Christmas is about isn't it?\\r\\nSonia: Yes always think that Christmas is family time and then New Year's Eve is for having fun!  \\r\\nChris: Talking of which I have a couple of passes for DeVinci's on New Year's Eve. It was a free gift for a big order we handled at work. Do you fancy joining me?\\r\\nSonia: Yes love to - I love that place! It has great music and lots of interesting people!\\r\\nChris: Yes....there are a lot of extroverts there plus the fashion lot.\\r\\nSonia: I know! I love being part of their world. Their clothes are amazing!\\r\\nChris: Amazing or just mad!  Anyway the ticket's yours! Catch up with you before Christmas!\\r\\nSonia: Cheers!             Sonia will visit her brother on Christmas Eve. Chris will spend it at his mother's and will come back the day after.

What has been your favourite moment of the ceremony so far?\\r\\nStorm: Just joined. I'm enjoying the speech by President Marcon. I pray ppl in my country are listening. I hope our current ruler is listening. We are on very thin ice over here in the US. I don't think ppl truly understand the value of the past.\\r\\nPatte: Macron's speech (and I am not a particular fan of his)\\r\\nLaura: Brian the musical performances.\\r\\nDenis: The view from the Arc down the Champs. Seeing the lettering on the monument, and the students reading the letters of soldiers.\\r\\nAngie: Brian when he said nationalism was the opposite of patriotism. So true and I wish others would realize it.\\r\\nAnne: \"Nationalism is the betrayal of patriotism \" Macron, 11/11/2018 Love it!\\r\\nMargaret: My daughter went to a local fair in Sydney today and all the hundreds attending fell silent at 11am. Very moving!\\r\\nDenis:  Its a Beautiful moment in the history of the world\\r\\nJan: Unfortunate that when a letter by Remarque was being read in German, both CNN and BBC reporters starting talking about something else.\\r\\nLaura: I am so sorry for every Country's loss of friends, family, neighbors and Citizens. So many attending are emotional. My heart and prayers go out to all of them.😪\\r\\nTom: in fact African leaders shouldn't have been invited because they have failed Africa and the world as a whole\\r\\nPatte: Tom you don't understand the global capital. Europe is a partner to the demise of Africa. African leaders have colluded with global capital. go read up on Togo politics.\\r\\nDestiny: There's no single benefit after war, Sincere peace is the ultimate. Therefore I urge the whole world to embrace peace.\\r\\nAngie: Agree!\\r\\nLarry: War is what comes when people give up on peaceful solutions . Ideas are what keep us from war. Love and Trust are always better than Fear and Doubt.\\r\\nLarry:  Today is Veterans Day in the US.  We honor everyone’s service to their respective countries \\r\\nPeter:  What about the killings that are happening right now because of you and your allies, around the world or the middle east to be precise.\\r\\nKafuka: exactly my thoughts.\\r\\nLarry: The United States has always tried to be peaceful and honorable. Are we perfect? No! But at least we try. We never asked for 911.\\r\\nKafuka: Larry, leave Internet. Now.         What Storm and Patte liked the most about the ceremony was President Marcon's speech. Laura's favourite moment was musical performances. Denis liked the view from the Arc down the Champs. Destiny, Angie and Larry stand for peaceful solutions. Larry and Kafuka are against US military actions.                   5\n12237    13611894                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Mary: Hi there! I can see on FB that you've visited Cracow. I was in the Golden Duck restaurant exactly one week ago! What a meeting it could have been!\\r\\nPaul: Yeah, would've been funny.\\r\\nMary: did you stay in a hotel? or with a friend?\\r\\nPaul: Swing hotel.\\r\\nMary: I stayed in a hostel, pretty cheap.\\r\\nMary: and quite near the city centre, 15 mins walk.\\r\\nPaul: If you go by car, it sucks to stay in the centre.\\r\\nMary: probably.\\r\\nPaul: you can take Uber to the hotel for 14 zlotys.\\r\\nMary: sounds not too bad. \\r\\nMary: did you go with your gf?\\r\\nPaul: Yeap.\\r\\nMary: Everything's fine with you two, right?\\r\\nPaul: Mostly\\r\\nMary: congratulations then!\\r\\nPaul: thanks. And how about you? Getting married soon?\\r\\nMary: not yet, I think. Generally it's fine, but maybe too early to decide.\\r\\nPaul: yeah, probably.\\r\\nMary: that's right ;)\\r\\nPaul: ;)                         Both Mary and Paul were in Cracow last week but didn't meet. Paul stayed at the Swing hostel, far from the centre, but he travelled cheap by Uber. Mary stayed at a hostel near the centre. Paul is ok with his girlfriend. Mary wants to get married, but it's too early to decide.                   5\n12262    13820785

They want to come back in summer with other people.                  5\n12337  13828168-1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Tina: <file_photo>\\r\\nTina: Dear Ella and Jamie, we wish you a wonderful Christmas - wherever you are going to celebrate it!\\r\\nElla: <file_photo>\\r\\nElla: Thank you my dear! From our Havana abode we are wishing you a lovely time with your family at Christmas!\\r\\nElla: Have you got some Xmas tree? Here in Cuba nobody celebrates Christmas, it seems. But a holiday flat opposite ours has some sort of Xmas decoration.\\r\\nElla: <file_photo>\\r\\nTina: <file_photo>\\r\\nTina: My little Christmas tree, bought on the side of the road, made by Africans.\\r\\nElla: I think I like this tree very much!\\r\\nTina: :)) Bill is rather skeptical and says that its only good feature is that it will shed no needles. Will you be celebrating?\\r\\nElla: Not really. In fact we never do, apart from a few jokes about a Xmas dinner. In a country like this it is easy to forget it is Christmastide. We really don't care. I would still do something at home but don't bother while travelling. And you?\\r\\nTina: My daughter Laura and her hubby are coming down from Jo'burg, so I guess we'll have a grand Christmas meal. Bill loves preparing all these English things and Laura is quite mad about them too. I'll bake a proper south African sugarcane cake.\\r\\nElla: Never tried this one!\\r\\nTina: It's really a joke, more of a traditional name than anything. And too sweet to be enjoyed. Just a Xmas treat. Did you have traditional dishes in Poland, the ones your mother used to prepare for Christmas?\\r\\nElla: Oh yes, plenty! But I liked only few of them. I wish I could taste them again though. :( weep,weep..\\r\\nTina: Good old days of childhood... When I think about Howick in the days of my childhood and how it has changed for worse, it makes me cringe. Good that my mother didn't live long enough to experience all this deterioration. No good thoughts for Xmas.\\r\\nElla: But good to remember our loved ones!\\r\\nTina: Right you are. Then once more: Happy Christmas to you both!\\r\\nElla: And a happy Christmas to you, dear Tina and Bill! With kind regards to your family!\\r\\nTina: Thank you dear.          Tina and Ella wish each other a happy Christmas. Ella and Jamie are spending Christmas in their Havana abode and they do not plan to celebrate. Tina bought a Christmas tree.

But we all know what those people are about, what they want.\\r\\nBarbara: Just like with Hitler. I've recently read an article from an American newspaper from 1930s. The journalist was arguing that Hitler would be civilised soon and won't implement his sick plans. in fact he only got worse\\r\\nElizabeth: So you think we are heading for a catastrophe?\\r\\nBarbara: Yes, I think we should understand that we're heading there. Why should it not happen? It's just a logical result of what's happening now.\\r\\nWilliam: I'm starting to think the same.\\r\\nRobert: But what can we do?\\r\\nRobert: engage in activism?\\r\\nBarbara: Trying to talk to people, oppose the vicious ideas of nation etc.\\r\\nElizabeth: I must admit I actually feel quite helpless\\r\\nRobert: I think this is what most of us feel\\r\\nBarbara: yes, but maybe we should do something? anything.\\r\\nWilliam: maybe we should...           Barbara is disturbed by the news from Spain. The fascist party \"Vox\" came to power in Andalusia. Almost all Europe is having similar problems right now. Barbara and William think we're heading for a catastrophe. Barbara thinks they need to start talking to people and oppose the wrong ideas.                  5\n12522    13729941                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Alice: How was your night out with the new boy?\\r\\nFiona: We had a wonderful time out... all good\\r\\nAlice: Pray do tell...\\r\\nAlice: Where did you go?\\r\\nFiona: We went out to that new Chinese place that opened up around the corner from the Queens Head\\r\\nAlice: I was thinking of going and checking it out the other day. What's their food like?\\r\\nFiona: Surprisingly good value for money.\\r\\nAlice: What did you order?\\r\\nFiona: Sweet and Sour pork and Lemon Chicken.\\r\\nAlice: Big servings?\\r\\nFiona: Quite substantial and reasonably cheap.\\r\\nAlice: What about the service?\\r\\nFiona: Pleasant and quick. Not your usual cheap and nasty place. The decor lacks a bit but overall I'd say definitely give them a try.\\r\\nAlice: Sounds good. I'll have to persuade Hugh that it's a good idea. He really hates Asian food.\\r\\nFiona: Oh that's a pity! :-(\\r\\nAlice: I know. He really doesn't know what he's missing out on. I could eat it all the time.\\r\\nFiona: Same here\\r\\nAlice: But do tell me more about the new boy...\\r\\nFiona: Well so far so good... We like similar things and have similar tastes in music.\\r\\nAlice: Do you think he's a keeper?\\r\\nFiona: Definitely! But time will tell...\\r\\nAlice: Fingers crossed! You really deserve a good man after everything you've been through.\\r\\nFiona: Yeah I know. If it only were this easy to tell the arseholes from the good ones.\\r\\nAlice: LOL yep they all seem good to start with... then the truth starts to rear it's ugly head and the next thing you know you find out that they forgot to tell you that they have a wife, 3 kids and a raging drug habit. The devil's in the details... lol\\r\\nFiona: hehehe... exactly. Look I've gotta go cause I have to prepare for a work meeting tomorrow. Been nice chatting. Take care.\\r\\nAlice: Absolutely. See you at work tomorrow! :-)\\r\\nFiona: Thanks :-)            Fiona has a new boy. They are getting along well. They went to a new Chinese place around the corner from the Queens Head, which has tasty and reasonably priced food and good service. Fiona ate Sweet and Sour pork and Lemon Chicken. Alice would like to go there, but Hugh hates Asian food.                   5\n12537    13611551                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Alex: hey, I'm writing about the book :)\\r\\nElizabeth: heey, thanks for the message, I'm packing it to my bag right now.\\r\\nAlex: thank you so much...you don't even know grateful I am\\r\\nElizabeth: No problem, really. If I can help you in any other way just ask.\\r\\nAlex: Actually I have a few questions for you if you don't mind\\r\\nElizabeth: Sure, what is it?\\r\\nAlex: I'm starting with the senior group next week and I'm so stressed out cause I never taught the adults...could you give me any clues how to prepare, what to do and so on?\\r\\nElizabeth: Of course. First thing - relax, cause stress is destructive. I remember my first classes with the adults and I couldn't even breath, but the point is to devise you own work schedule, and in order to do it right you just gotta observe them. their knowledge, their needs and so on.\\r\\nAlex: I get it...and how does your lesson usually look like?\\r\\nElizabeth: It depends, you know. But for most of the time I'm just trying to stick to my fixed plan. At the beginning checking the attendance, asking them to give me the date in the foreing language so I can put it down in the register. Then a short conversation.\\r\\nAlex: and what after that?\\r\\nElizabeth: Then I usually start a new chapter, the vocabulary, sometimes grammar, a few exercices and then work in groups. I don't want them to do the exercices only, cause it's too automatic.\\r\\nAlex: sounds really cool...you are so experienced...I wish I was too :/\\r\\nElizabeth: calm down, you'll just learn everything with practice. If you don't want to make your lessons too formal, you can look for some games. I recommend Kaboom.\\r\\nAlex: Kaboom? I don't know this game\\r\\nElizabeth: you just write the words on little pieces of paper, for example names of fruit or vegetables and put it all in a little bag. Every person takes out a single piece of paper and has to translate a word written on it. If they spot the answer, they keep it, if they don't, the card goes back to the bag.\\r\\nAlex: Sounds really cool! I'm sure I'll try it. Thank you so much for your help!!\\r\\nElizabeth: No problem, any time.                                                               Elizabeth is bringing a book for Alex. Alex needs advice on how to teach adults. Elizabeth suggests getting relaxed and devising own work schedule. Elizabeth describes her usual lesson. Elizabeth recommends a vocabulary game called Kaboom.                  5\n12549    13729909                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Lee: Hi is Marcus at yours?\\r\\nKaty: No he went out with Ella\\r\\nLee: Ok.

If it doesn't work, Lee will come by Katy's place to meet him.                   5\n12676    13680495                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Caron: Hiya jen..  are you still ok to have Luna from next Thurs to Monday?.. my bloody fantastic new car turned out shit..  the cam belt snapped while I was on the way to visit my dad in hospital I'm Coventry.. no the fuckers won't give me my money back so have to wait it out..

Alexander and Emma are sleepy today. Emma thinks it's due to the weather. Emma and Alexander wish for longer days to come. Emma has a Christmas family reunion. She feels stressed about it.                  5\n13086    13817750                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Claire: Hey, wanna go ice skating? :)\\r\\nPenny: Today?\\r\\nClaire: Yeah!\\r\\nPenny: Sorry, dear, I can't today.

We're testing all ice rinks in the city, so you can join us in our hunt for the best place ;)\\r\\nPenny: With pleasure! Which one have you tested so far? ;)\\r\\nClaire: Alexandra Park, National History Museum, going to the Crystal Palace today.\\r\\nPenny: Cool place! I've been there couple of times.\\r\\nPenny: Do you have your own skates?\\r\\nClaire: Jack and I do, but Tina's quite reluctant to buy a pair.\\r\\nPenny: Hm, if she likes it, she definitely should buy her own. It's quite disgusting when you think about using someone else's skates... Especially if you go to so many places.\\r\\nPenny: Crystal Palace is great, but not with the hygiene...\\r\\nClaire: Oh, is that so? Maybe this will convince Tina. I think she just hasn't made up her mind if she wants to continue or not.\\r\\nPenny: I see. Ok, have to go, Mike will be here in an hour\\r\\nClaire: Tell him I wish him happy birthday! See you, have fun!        Claire is testing ice skating rinks. She's already been to Alexandra Park and National History Museum. She is going to the Crystal Palace today. She wants Penny to join her, Jack, and Tina but Penny is busy with Mike's birthday preparations. Jack and Claire have their own skates, Tina doesn't.                  5\n13144    13829643

of your birds' feeder. Do you want me to replace the feeding table? You'd put a new one next to it.\\r\\nDoris: Hi Andy! What do YOU think? Is the old one in a condition promising a couple of years of service?\\r\\nAndy: I should think so. Slightly rotten on one side but I can put some silicon all over it, so it'll survive a few more years.\\r\\nDoris: Splendid! Do so.\\r\\nAndy: But I'll have to get a new and longer screw. The one you provided is turning loose in the wood.\\r\\nDoris: No pro. Buy whatever you need and I'll pay you back.\\r\\nAndy: OK. I'll get you a pic when it's ready.\\r\\nDoris: Ta!                                                   Andy is about to repair Doris' birds' feeder. Andy can make the current feeding table last a couple of years more. Doris agrees to keep it. Andy has to get a new screw, as the one Doris provided is not adequate. Doris will pay Andy back for the screw.                  5\n13173    13828915                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    William: Hello Morah! A new update on our whereabouts. Just moved over to Merida after a long drive from Cancun. Empty roads giving you a weird feeling.\\r\\nWilliam: <file_photo>\\r\\nWilliam: We had all possible difficulties finding our airbnb accommodation and after much asking around and consulting our paltry maps, we gave up and phoned our host who navigated us to the house. It turned out to be located in a semi-fenced residential area outside the city. Quite a pretty and comfy place for that and entirely for us alone.\\r\\nWilliam: <file_photo>\\r\\nWilliam: So we finally had a goodnight's sleep and are looking forward to do some sightseeing in the capital of Yucatan.\\r\\nMorah: So good to hear from you! The house looks very comfortable indeed.\\r\\nWilliam: We even have two bedrooms but Sarah's bravely putting up with my snoring so we're using only one ;-)\\r\\nMorah: You even seem to have a small terrace in front of the house. Quite posh!\\r\\nWilliam: We tried to have our sundowner on it yesterday but mosquitoes from the whole neighbourhood decided to join us, so we had to withdraw before they'd sucked us bloodless.\\r\\nMorah: Too bad! It looks a pretty area around the house though.\\r\\nWilliam: We have a very pleasant parkland just in front of the house, even with a small Maya ruin. But they seem to be everywhere!\\r\\nMorah: Have you consulted Hobbs on its name? I bet he knows everything about every ruin in Mexico.\\r\\nWilliam: Only in the Yucatan peninsula. About the rest of Maya monuments he knows only 99%. He keeps giving us invaluable tips and pieces of advice. Grand chap!\\r\\nMorah: Yes, he is. And not this type of a boring, dried-up professor one might expect. I quite like him too.\\r\\nWilliam: I know you do ;)\\r\\nMorah: I don't even see as much of him.\\r\\nWilliam: As you would love to.\\r\\nMorah: :D\\r\\nWilliam: Once we are back we'll invite you two for a slide show, right?\\r\\nMorah: And maybe two other people in order not to make it too obvious?\\r\\nWilliam: Granted!\\r\\nMorah: Oh so lovely chatting with you. Have a great time travelling. And keep me posted.\\r\\nWilliam: I will. Take care!    William and Sarah just moved to Merida after a long drive from Cancun. They had problems finding their accommodation. The house is two-bedroomed but they are using one. The area around the house and the house itself is nice. William will invite Morah and others for a slide show when they are back.                  5\n13185    13730824                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Leslie: Hi, you ok?\\r\\nAmy: Yes, not too bad, still in a lot of pain, painkillers help, but they have certain unfortunate side effects!\\r\\nLeslie: Yes, I know exactly what you mean! Have lots of dried prunes and apricots, they help, in my experience.\\r\\nAmy: Oh thanks, I'll ask Andy to go and get some. How's everything at school, missing me?\\r\\nLeslie: Course we are! The new guy seems OK, though, he's managing alright with everything. \\r\\nAmy: How's Robyn, she feeling more confident?\\r\\nLeslie: Not really! She's been crying in the ladies toilets most afternoons still.\\r\\nAmy: Her classes any better behaved?\\r\\nLeslie: No, definitely not! I was talking to Julian who has the lab next door to her classroom. He said that all the kids in one particular class are trying to get out of the doorway at once, a sort of cork popping out from a bottle scenario!\\r\\nAmy: Hmm, sounds funny, but there could be safety issues, I'd have a quiet word with Robyn if I were you.\\r\\nLeslie: I'll try, but she's so sensitive and paranoid. She already thinks I'm picking on her!\\r\\nAmy: Yes, but we can't allow that kind of thing to carry on, a child could get hurt!\\r\\nLeslie: OK, I'll gently suggest some strategies. Maybe Julian could nip out and check next Friday last lesson, or at least keep an ear out. I have a cover period then, so if I'm not called, I'll pop over Friday too.\\r\\nAmy: If she doesn't improve, we'll have to do something official. Keep an eye on her for a few weeks, see how it goes.\\r\\nLeslie: I don't want to get the senior management team involved yet, just keep it in our dept. I think I'll talk to her to tomorrow.\\r\\nAmy: Good! How are your kids?\\r\\nLeslie: Joshua is fine, he's in the Christmas play as a donkey, but school are sorting the costume, thank God! Katie ìs fine too, she's learning the clarinet and playing in the Comp's concert in the orchestra so she's a bit nervous. Both looking forward to Christmas, Joshua excited about the elves, he seems fascinated by them. We have the elf on the shelf thing going on, he loves that, Katie plays along too!\\r\\nAmy: We didn't have that when mine were little, sounds fun! Just the Advent calendar and Christingles and things! Sam was a bit of a pyromaniac so we had to be extra careful with him and candles!\\r\\nLeslie: Well, I'm careful with Josh too, he's only 6 and very clumsy!\\r\\nAmy: OK, enjoy the rest of the term, see you in January, all being well.\\r\\nLeslie: Make sure you're totally well before you come back! Have a lovely Christmas! Oh, and I'll keep you informed about Robyn and her issues.\\r\\nAmy: Great! The dept is in good hands with you!\\r\\nLeslie: Thanks, now rest yourself!

Do we need to pay extra?\\nPeter: We all will have a silver package which means we can use up to three treatments.\\nJanet: Perfect! Thank you!   Peter is organizing the upcoming trip.

It costs a lot to be a member\\nTom: They are all in some kind of unions with their bigger neighbours, which are (apart from Switzerland and Liechtenstein) members of the EU and even the Schengen Area\\nKim: right, makes sense\\nKim: but I read today that San Marino kept a referendum about joining the EU at some point\\nKim: and they even voted \"YES\"\\nTom: really? so what happened?\\nKim: the turnout was too low, so the result was invalid\\nLena: so I really don't understand why they are not members\\nJeff: but they are in the EU anyway, just not officially\\nLena: exactly, very strange\\nTom: I found the answer! In 2012 the European Commission published a report about it\\nTom: And they wrote: \"\"the EU institutions are currently not adapted to the accession of such small-sized countries\". It's from wikipedia\\nKim: great! thanks!         Lena, Kim, Jeff and Tom are studying for the EU law exam. Malta and Luxembourg are members of the EU. Other microstates are not. San Marino kept the referendum about joining the EU, but the result was invalid.

;/\\r\\nRay: I don’t get it, whats goin on\\r\\nKale: They are in crisis, but whyyy\\r\\nRay: Heard sth about the money, sponsor withdrew after the scandal with Diego\\r\\nKale: Yea, what was that about?\\r\\nRay: Somebody claimed they saw him doing drugs after the game, there was an article in Football Observer\\r\\nKale: Was it true?\\r\\nRay: Probably not, at least no pictures were published but supposedly the case went to court\\r\\nKale: So why did they go away\\r\\nRay: The sponsors?\\r\\nKale: Yupp\\r\\nRay: You know, even false accusations may fuck people up and destroy reputation\\r\\nKale: Sickkkk                  Ray and Kale watched the game today. The game was bad and the team are in financial crisis. Their sponsor withdrew after the scandal with Diego who supposedly did drugs after the game, which was covered in Football Observer. Probably it wasn't true, but it damaged their reputation.                    5\n14034    13862490                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Calvin: Dude.

Calvin will ask her when she wants to meet and will text Columbus later.                  5\n14054    13865217                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Derek: As the Christmas time is almost upon us, I thought it may be a good idea to organise Secret Santa. What do you think?\\nAnna: It's a marvellous idea!\\nMichael: How does it work?\\nDerek: You draw the person for whom you're going to buy a gift.\\nPatricia: It's so cool! Please do it! Keep in mind that it must be a secret who everyone gets!\\nMichael: Oh, ok\\nDerek: Patricia's right. It's more fun when we don't tell each other who've got\\nAnna: Are we organising it just for our team or the whole department?\\nDerek: I don't know. I thought the department may be more fun, but then we don't know each other that well, so it may be quite troublesome to buy a right gift\\nPatricia: Yeah, but the point of Secret Santa is not buying precisely what the other person wants, but just having a bit of fun\\nMichael: I think we should stick to our team. There's the right number and I think 20 is enough\\nAnna: Hm, you may be right.\\nDerek: Ok, so now - price range. What do you reckon?\\nPatricia: 30?\\nMichael: It's quite a lot...\\nPatricia: Well, can you buy a decent gift for less than that? I'm not talking about buying someone a candle...\\nAnna: Hahaha, please guys don't buy each others candles...\\nDerek: Linda from HR loves candles\\nPatricia: Oh course she does\\nMichael: Can we make it 20 then?\\nDerek: For me it sounds fair\\nPatricia: I think it's ok\\nAnna: I agree, you can find something nice for 20 quid                                                                                                                               Christmas is approaching. Derek proposes organising Secret Santa for the team. There are 20 people in the team. Anna, Michael and Patricia agree. The price range is 20 pounds.                  5\n14292    13682468

She gave birth to a baby girl yesterday.\\r\\nMary: Congrats! That is a great news.\\r\\nDan: The doctor has advised her rest for a week. It was cesarean.\\r\\nMary: Oh I see. Hope there is no complications.\\r\\nDan: No, nothing much, just that she needs to rest till the stitches are removed.\\r\\nMary: Now that you both have become new parents you will be finding it difficult to cope up with the night’s sleep. Don’t you?\\r\\nDan: I believe it is quite normal with a newborn baby.\\r\\nMary: Yes, I had to undergo this when my elder child was born.\\r\\nDan: You have 2 kids, right?\\r\\nMary: Yes.\\r\\nDan: Hope that must have been a tough time for you guys.\\r\\nMary: It was, initially. But we got through it gradually.

Not so bad. And yourself?\\r\\nAndy: So so.\\r\\nDana: What is it? Your backbone?\\r\\nAndy: Yeah... Bloody hell! I feel like an invalid walking with the stick.\\r\\nDana: What did the doc say?\\r\\nAndy: The same. Only an operation can be a chance.\\r\\nDana: Oh god!\\r\\nAndy: Exactly! The only chance but it can be also that I end up in a wheelchair.\\r\\nDana: Didn't you want to get a second opinion?\\r\\nAndy: It is the second opinion.\\r\\nDana: Sounds shitty. And if you don't do anything, will it be getting worse?\\r\\nAndy: Nobody can tell. So I think I won't do anything. Until it gets unbearable. Then there won't be any risk anyway. What d'you think?\\r\\nDana: Yeah. I'd do the same. I mean, have a normal life as before. As much as possible. Maybe medicine will make better progress than your poor backbone.\\r\\nAndy: My point. Precisely! \\r\\nDana: Cheer up! It's not so bad. And soon you're over here and we'll see.\\r\\nAndy: Right. Can't wait to be with you.\\r\\nDana: Me too bro!                                                                                                          Andy's having serious problems with his backbone. His only chance is to have an operation. There's a risk he'd end up in a wheelchair. He decided not to do it. He's meeting his sister, Dana, soon.                  5\n14478    13715894

There is only one copy of it in the library and someone has already borrowed it.\\r\\nCharlie: Hello, Lily! I am afraid I cannot help you - I do not own a copy of this book, I borrowed it form professor Roberts myself.\\r\\nLily: Thank you, I will ask professor Roberts than.\\r\\nCharlie: Lily, have you submitted your paper? I cannot find it.\\r\\nLily: Yes, I have or at least I think I have. I will check it.\\r\\nLily: Professor Davis, I am so sorry, I was certain that I have done this. Could I submit my paper now?\\r\\nCharlie: Yes, of course. :)\\r\\nLily: Thank you!\\r\\nLily: <file_other>\\r\\nCharlie: You are welcome! Could you please remind your classmates to do the same? So far I have received only ten papers..\\r\\nLily: Yes, of course, I will do this.\\r\\nCharlie: Thank you, Lily! By the way I have already read your paper. It is very well written and you made some really good points - it is an A+ work! :)\\r\\nLily: Thank you, Professor Davis! And once again thank you letting me submit it after the deadline.\\r\\nCharlie: It is not a big deal. :) Nevertheless I would be really glad, if the rest of the students sent their papers to me soon.              Charlie can't lend Lilly the book she asked about, as he has himself borrowed it from prof. Roberts. Lilly forgot to submit her paper before the deadline, but Charlie allows her to do it now. Charlie is pleased with Lilly's paper.

Why? What's up?\\r\\nJenni: Well, last night you said you'll come over to mine at 8pm. So I'm waiting... and waiting... and you're at the goddamned pub.\\r\\nPaul: I don't remember saying that I'd come to yours tonight\\r\\nJenni: Isn't that just ever so convenient... hmmm... \\r\\nPaul: Honestly hun I would've never said that. It's pub quiz night at the Lion's Head. You know that's what I do every Tues.\\r\\nJenni: Yeah but you said that this Tues you'd come and see me. You know that's the only night of the week that I have off and you can't even make the effort to see me... grrrr!\\r\\nPaul: Look I make lots of effort to do things for you babe... all the fucking time! I need a night off with my mates. \\r\\nJenni: You have 'nights off' with your fucking mates all the bloody time... but when I ask you to do anything you're always busy and not available.\\r\\nJenni: Are you giving me the silent treatment now? \\r\\nJenni: Can't even be bothered to answer my messages?\\r\\nJenni: Who are you with down the pub? \\r\\nPaul: Sorry babe, was busy talking to Lauren at the bar. Why don't you pop down the pub and we can talk about this?\\r\\nJenni: WTF?!! Who the fuck is Lauren??!!! \\r\\nJenni: Are you fucking her?\\r\\nPaul: Don't be ridiculous! She's like as old as your mother. LOL\\r\\nJenni: You can't be fucked to come over and see me. Then when I try to find out where you are you tell me that you're at the quiz night with your mates. You don't even have the courtesy to tell me that you're not coming over to mine. Now you tell me that you're talking to some old hag by the name of Lauren at the bar. What bloody planet do you live on? You're a dick!\\r\\nJenni: You know what? You can shove this relationship where the sun don't shine! I've had enough. \\r\\nJenni: You better come over tomorrow because I'm throwing all your shit out Mr. Fucktard! It'll be on the front lawn if you want it. Fuck you!   Paul is at the pub. Jenni is waiting for him, but he doesn't remember them arranging a meeting. He attends a pub quiz night at Lion's Head every Tuesday. Now he's there pub with a woman named Lauren and he invites Jenni to pop down the pub and talk. Jenny is furious and wants Paul to come tomorrow.                  5\n14585    13730616                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Chris: I'm lost. Been looking for the place for the last 20 min. Tried to call you but no answer.\\r\\nJim: It's bad reception over here that's why you couldn't get through.\\r\\nJim: Where are you?\\r\\nChris: On the corner of Station and Church St.\\r\\nJim: The place is behind the white house on the corner.\\r\\nJim: Go down the driveway. Then turn right into the public footpath. Walk another 50 yards and there should be a gate on your left.\\r\\nChris: OK.\\r\\nChris: <file_photo>\\r\\nChris: Is that the house you mean?\\r\\nJim: Yeah that's the place on the corner. Now go down the driveway.\\r\\nChris: OK.\\r\\nChris: I think I might have found it.\\r\\nChris: Is it the place with the yellow gate?\\r\\nJim: Yeah, that's the one.\\r\\nJim: I'll come downstairs and open the gate for you.\\r\\nChris: OK. I'm out the front.\\r\\nJim: Be down there in 5. Just have to lock the dogs up.\\r\\nJim: See you soon.\\r\\nChris: No probs.\\r\\nJim: :-)              Chris is on the corner of Station and Church St. Chris has been looking for the place for the last 20 minutes and couldn't reach Jim over the phone. Jim gives Chris directions about how to get to the place. Jim will open the gate for Chris in 5 minutes. Jim has to lock up the dogs first.                  5\n14599    13680294                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Alex: Hi there!\\r\\nMatt: Hey!\\r\\nAlex: What are you up to?\\r\\nMatt: Nothing special, at my 5th unpaid job at the moment, doing social media\\r\\nAlex: Lmao It can't be that bad. Which social media?\\r\\nMatt: TWITTER\\r\\nAlex: Hmm that's an entire new dimension to explore\\r\\nMatt: Without a doubt, this has brought 3D into my life. A considerable improvement\\r\\nAlex: Man, what's happening to you, you're jokes aren't even funny anymore\\r\\nMatt: There you go, the aftereffects of 3D\\r\\nAlex: So what are you actually doing?\\r\\nMatt: Well actually/to be fair/quite frankly unpaid job number 5 is not that bad at all. I'm working for this association which organises a few events during the year and I'm the Secretary, which looks cool on the cv. And has made me learn what twitter actually is. Before I only knew it from the news, because of Trump lol\\r\\nAlex: ha ha ha! And What are you promoting atm?\\r\\nMatt: I'm going to casually mention that we're having an event at the British Library and that's what I'm promoting\\r\\nAlex: wow sounds really good\\r\\nMatt: Yer, good opportunity for networking and I work with really nice people too\\r\\nAlex: That's cool\\r\\nMatt: I think it could hardly be better actually. It's also true that these professional British people can sometimes be extremely unprofessional, but this might be the most entertaining part of the job to be fair. The other day, for instance, my colleagues sent me a promo leaflet which repeatedly mentioned the British Museum and I immediately circulated it through all our social media, mailing list, etc. Turned out it was supposed to be the British Library. Can you dig it?\\r\\nAlex: Ahahahaha that's hilarious!! I'm speechless\\r\\nMatt: Well, so am I. Really glad that it's not a paid job actually\\r\\nAlex: That's a nice silver lining you've got there\\r\\nMatt: lol But hey, I think I should go back to TWITTER and then jump back to unpaid job number 1. Will I see you soon?\\r\\nAlex: ok, no worries. Sure, this weekend?\\r\\nMatt: Yeah, I do think so. Is it rude to suggest we meet at YOURS? I'll bring wine\\r\\nAlex: ha ha ha Sure, no problem. Shall we say Saturday at mine?\\r\\nMatt: Sounds good! Let's just confirm during the week\\r\\nAlex: Will do\\r\\nMatt: It was nice to talk though\\r\\nAlex: Yeah.

Just thought I'd drop you a line before disappearing to the other side of the world. At the moment I'm on the train to Frankfurt airport, then off to Cuba for 5 weeks. Can't wait to be there!\\r\\nHarry: A very good morning to you dear Tessy! How nice you are in touch. So travelling again? Gosh, you've got stamina!\\r\\nTessy: I wonder myself. Truth to tell I'm slightly apprehensive. Never been to Cuba. Have you?\\r\\nHarry: No, I'm not that adventurous but Maya was. Last summer with her boys. And I think she was very enthusiastic.But I remember no details. Why don't you ask her? She may have a tip or two.\\r\\nTessy: A bit too late now :)) but I will definitely contact her. Still she can give me a few good tips. Do you remember if internet is really such a disaster there?\\r\\nHarry: Oh yes, it is. She was gone for 2 weeks and I heard from her twice: from the Havana airport when she arrived and on leaving.\\r\\nTessy: I see! My Super Mario boss is expecting me to be online all the time - just in case. LOL\\r\\nHarry: What a charming person. Have you told him to fuck off?\\r\\nTessy: More or less. And hey how are you? Tied down to the ground?\\r\\nHarry: I hate winter for that reason. But still had a fantastic flying season this year. Can't complain really. We've been thinking about a skiing holiday though at Xmas.\\r\\nTessy: Smashing! Where to?\\r\\nHarry: Actually that's an adventurous part - to Israel. They seem to have some incredible slopes with topnotch infrastructure. A bloke from Notts Club was there last year and couldn't praise it too much.\\r\\nTessy: Funny enough I remember seeing their skiing brochures when we were there back in 2000. Sooo long time ago. By now it can be only better. Wouldn't it bit more on a pricey side?\\r\\nHarry: We'll manage 2 weeks. And it can't be more expensive that Austria.Not to mention Switzerland. They're gone mad there, with all those Chinks and Russkis. Nobody else can afford it any more.\\r\\nTessy: Apart from royals in Kitzbühel :)) \\r\\nHarry: Molly has found out about a package, with the flight, full board, accommodation. You only have to pay your ski passes.\\r\\nTessy: And that's where they are making their money! And on apres-skis!\\r\\nHarry: I can easily give a miss to a fancy apres-ski! Have you had any bookings? They surely have nice all-inclusive places in Cuba.\\r\\nTessy: Not at all! Otherwise prices are exorbitant. But those affordable ones always have horrible write-ups. Yes, I've booked all my accommodation. Airbnb, I like to support the locals :)\\r\\nHarry: Very noble of you. But it's a bit of a tossup: you can get a superb flat or land in a rubbish hip. I definitely prefer hotels.\\r\\nTessy: I AM more adventurous. Anyway it is safe, Cuba is said to be very safe even for woman travelling alone.\\r\\nHarry: And ravishing blonde on top of it! But be careful.\\r\\nTessy: STB you are.\\r\\nHarry: What the hell is STB?\\r\\nTessy: Swet Talking Bastard. Anyway it was great to chat with you. I think we're approaching Frankfurt.

I love and hate to be here at the same time.\\r\\nDennis: So you aren't travelling alone, I presume.\\r\\nLaura: No, my travelling companion takes me along, so to speak, to his winter quarters, since his health doesn't cope that well with European winters. I couldn't afford these travels entirely on my own of course.\\r\\nDennis: Always thought Cuba is not expensive. Especially the post-Fidel Cuba.\\r\\nLaura: Just the contrary. In the good old days when it was supported by the Soviet Union, the living standard was not bad and they didn't have to rely on income from tourism. Then it all went down the drain, even famine and food rationing have become their daily thing. Since early 00s most not rationed goods are available only for CUC, their convertible currency. The bottom line being that whatever you buy as a tourist, you pay +/- western prices.\\r\\nDennis: So how much do you two spend daily?\\r\\nLaura: Staying in private houses about at least 100€, including food, transport and entrance fees. These days we are compelled to stay at a state-run Hotel and pay thru the nose - 130€ a night. No, Cuba is not cheap. But Havana Club YES.\\r\\nDennis: Don't like the stuff at all.\\r\\nLaura: Me neither. Gives me headaches. Even one glass of it.\\r\\nDennis: What you say will make me think twice before setting sail for Cuba.\\r\\nLaura: But it can be fantastic as well.

I don't want them to do the exercices only, cause it's too automatic.\\r\\nAlex: sounds really cool...you are so experienced...I wish I was too :/\\r\\nElizabeth: calm down, you'll just learn everything with practice. If you don't want to make your lessons too formal, you can look for some games. I recommend Kaboom.\\r\\nAlex: Kaboom?

Our kids were friends at school. \\r\\nMonika: Sophie from England?\\r\\nKeith: That's right, you do remember.\\r\\nMonika: I remember your Sophie punching my Paweł in the face, and me complaining to the school about it. How is she, anyway? Has she managed to stay out of prison?\\r\\nKeith: Yes, she is in Croatia now, for the holiday. She only punched him in the face because he was hitting her, by the way.\\r\\nMonika: Yes, but he was only hitting her because he liked her. But when she punched him back she broke his glasses, and you refused to pay for a new pair.\\r\\nKeith: That's right! So glad you remember us.                                      Monika's son Paweł and Keith's daughter Sophie were going to school together. Paweł used to hit Sophie, because he liked her. Sophie hit Paweł back once and broke his glasses. Keith refused to pay for Paweł's glasses.

Just got back from hols, had a great time, lovely weather too!\\r\\nTina: God, yes you have! Right in the middle of a heatwave, brilliant timing!\\r\\nSally: Yes, and unusual for a British summer! We had some lovely days out too.\\r\\nTina: Where'd you go?\\r\\nSally: Widemouth Bay, Sandymouth Bay, Cambourne, Bodmin Railway, Seaton Trams, PeccoRama.\\r\\nTina: Sounds like you did plenty!\\r\\nSally: Yes, we also had a few days around Bude, where there's a lovely second hand bookshops, pasties everywhere etc. Oh yes, and a rowing boat trip or two!\\r\\nTina: Oh, I love being out on the water!\\r\\nSally: We discovered we're not seafaring folk! We went on a pedalo boat first, I was too fat for it and we were front heavy, so I had to get out, nearly fell in in the process and had to crawl out on my stomach.\\r\\nTina: That must have looked funny!\\r\\nSally: Was a bit embarrassing! Next time, we tried a rowing boat, but we were hopeless at rowing! Then Mitch hit his head on the wooden seat and we had to go to the hospital as he felt so dizzy. Luckily, he didn't have concussion. Decided to give boats a miss after that.\\r\\nTina: No wonder! Still, lovely that you enjoyed it on the whole. Bye, love!\\r\\nSally: Bye! See you in the gym this week?\\r\\nTina: Hope to, I must get back to 2 or 3 times a week!\\r\\nSally: I know, me too! See you!                             Sally came back from holiday. Summer is very warm in Britain this year. Sally visited a few different places, did a rowing boat trip and pedalo boat trip. Mitch hit his head on a wooden seat but did not have concussion. Sally wants to meet Tina in the gym next week.                  5\n2  13611892                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Anna: I am gonna kill Tom today.\\r\\nLisa: What happened?\\r\\nAnna: Can you imagine that he hasn't changed the baby's diaper for the whole day?\\r\\nLisa: Dear lord, no.\\r\\nAnna: Yes. the smell, the view when I finally changed Stevie - priceless\\r\\nLisa: Did you say something?\\r\\nAnna: Yes, I said: Are you fucking kidding me? Are you a complete idiot?\\r\\nLisa: And...?\\r\\nAnna: He said that a little pee never hurt anybody and that I'm overreacting\\r\\nLisa: Typical. Has he ever admitted that he screwed up?\\r\\nAnna: I honestly can't remember the last time he apologized to me. And it's getting really tiring, you know.\\r\\nLisa: I know, would you like Sam to talk to him? You know I can stir him into the right direction, he could really make him think\\r\\nAnna: I don't know... He's only gonna get mad.\\r\\nLisa: At Sam?\\r\\nAnna: At me.\\r\\nLisa: Oh, I see. Maybe you should try to talk to him, but like serious for once, not just in regards to you know, some one thing he messed up, but his general attitude.\\r\\nAnna: I know I should, but I am just so tired all the time, I get mad and then I just let it go.\\r\\nLisa: What do you say we leave Stevie with your sister and go to a SPA for a day during the weekend? A nice massage and a facial? Could only do you good.\\r\\nAnna: That would be absolutely fantastic.\\r\\nLisa: I will call the Dream SPA later today. Cheer up. It will all be okay.\\r\\nAnna: I love you <3 Thanks!!               Anna is angry as Tom hasn't changed Stevie's diaper for the whole day. Lisa thinks Anna should talk to Tom about his general attitude. Lisa and Anna want to go to a Spa for a day at the weekend. Lisa suggests leaving Stevie with Anna's sister.

What a brilliant idea :)\\r\\nAgnes: Cool :) Here are some gift inspirations, let me know what you think: <file_other>\\r\\nAgnes: <file_photo>\\r\\nJane: This first one is so sweet! OMG baby clothes are terrific!\\r\\nAlice: No offence, Agnes, but I think we should buy something more useful like a huge Pampers pack for example. I know that designer clothes are good quality and stuff but you know she won’t use them much and they will be too small in a blink of an eye anyway.\\r\\nAgnes: None taken, Alice. I just thought that diapers are kinda impersonal and she won’t even remember who she got them from.\\r\\nAlice: Sure, I get it. I just know that my baby shower gift turned out not to be very useful in a long term.\\r\\nKathy: Guys, how about some compromise? Both ideas are great so maybe we can buy a cheaper onesie, e.g. <file_other> and put it in a basket surrounded by diapers? Look: <file_photo>\\r\\nJane: Now that’s something worth considering.\\r\\nAlice: Win-win\\r\\nAgnes: I still think clothes are better, but we live in a world of democracy, so I won’t argue.\\r\\nKathy: Don’t be like this, Agnes…\\r\\nAgnes: Like what?\\r\\nAlice: A bitch?\\r\\nAgnes: EXCUSE ME? Did you just call me a B WORD?!?!?!?!\\r\\nJane: Oh boy\\r\\nAlice: Yes, I did. We want to do something special for our friend and you’re acting like a princess, so unless you stop to do so, I’m going to call you this :)\\r\\nAgnes: I won’t listen to this bullshit. Goodbye, Alice.\\r\\nJane: Did you just removed her from the conversation?\\r\\nKathy: Come on, Agnes, this was mean, but she just wants what’s best for Ursula.\\r\\nAgnes: You want to add something, Kathy?\\r\\nKathy: No, let’s move on.           Agnes wants to throw a baby shower for Ursula and suggests designer clothes as a gift. Alice opts for more practical gifts so Kathy suggests a compromise. Agnes thinks her suggestion is better. Agnes removed Alice from the conversation. Kathy thinks it was mean but wants to move on.                   5\n4  13729460                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Laura: Are you still coming to visit in December?\\r\\nKas: Looks like I can't make it as the other housemates are going home for Christmas :-(\\r\\nLaura: But you said that you would.\\r\\nKas: I know.

What a brilliant idea :)\nAgnes: Cool :) Here are some gift inspirations, let me know what you think: <file_other>\nAgnes: <file_photo>\nJane: This first one is so sweet! OMG baby clothes are terrific!\nAlice: No offence, Agnes, but I think we should buy something more useful like a huge Pampers pack for example. I know that designer clothes are good quality and stuff but you know she won’t use them much and they will be too small in a blink of an eye anyway.\nAgnes: None taken, Alice. I just thought that diapers are kinda impersonal and she won’t even remember who she got them from.\nAlice: Sure, I get it. I just know that my baby shower gift turned out not to be very useful in a long term.\nKathy: Guys, how about some compromise? Both ideas are great so maybe we can buy a cheaper onesie, e.g. <file_other> and put it in a basket surrounded by diapers? Look: <file_photo>\nJane: Now that’s something worth considering.\nAlice: Win-win\nAgnes: I still think clothes are better, but we live in a world of democracy, so I won’t argue.\nKathy: Don’t be like this, Agnes…\nAgnes: Like what?\nAlice: A bitch?\nAgnes: EXCUSE ME? Did you just call me a B WORD?!?!?!?!\nJane: Oh boy\nAlice: Yes, I did. We want to do something special for our friend and you’re acting like a princess, so unless you stop to do so, I’m going to call you this :)\nAgnes: I won’t listen to this bullshit. Goodbye, Alice.\nJane: Did you just removed her from the conversation?\nKathy: Come on, Agnes, this was mean, but she just wants what’s best for Ursula.\nAgnes: You want to add something, Kathy?\nKathy: No, let’s move on.\n******************************************************************************************\n==== PROCESSING EXAMPLES CONSISTING OF : 1 FACTS ====\nPROCESSING :  Agnes wants to throw a baby shower for Ursula and suggests designer clothes as a gift\nPROCESSING :  Agnes thinks her suggestion is better\nPROCESSING :  Alice opts for more practical gifts so Kathy suggests a compromise\nPROCESSING :  Agnes removed Alice from the conversation\nPROCESSING :  Kathy thinks it was mean but wants to move on\n==== PROCESSING EXAMPLES CONSISTING OF : 2 FACTS ====\nPROCESSING :  Agnes wants to throw a baby shower for Ursula and suggests designer clothes as a gift.

Except for the latter, nothing too urgent that cannot be put off until later.\nAndy: I have a huge deadline for tomorrow and really have to focus on it. Probably will finish by midday and from then on nothing too urgent.\nMark: I don't know how to tell you this, but I was supposed to have the next day off so I planned to finish all urgent tasks tomorrow.\nMr. Benson: Mark, can you cancel the day off? We really need your help here.\nMark: That's not really that important. I just need to make a few phone calls. When will you be back, Mr. Benson?\nMr. Benson: On Tuesday. Thank you, Mark. \nMark: Can I have Wednesday or Thursday off then? \nMr. Benson: Of course. I'll tell Lona later to book both days for you. One is on the company.\nMark: Thank you, sir. I'll be right back. \nMr. Benson: All right. Claudia - Since you have the smallest workload I want you to call all out major clients and ask them about client satisfaction. Lona has the survey, so ask her for it. \nClaudia: Of course. \nMr. Benson: You don't have much time, because I'll need the processed data by 11.\nClaudia: You'll have it on your e-mail by 10:30.\nMark: I'm back.\nMr. Benson: Thank you, Claudia. Andy - I need you to prepare a presentation on our company. Something for laymen, not too complicated and not too specialised. A lot of positive figures.\nAndy: No problem, sir. Do you need any specific data?\nMr. Benson: Financial, social and something intangible. \nAndy: By when do you need it?\nMr. Benson: By the end of the day. \nAndy: Will do. \nMr. Benson: Thank you, Andy. Mark - you get the hardest task. I want you to do some data mining.\nMark: Data mining? What am I looking for?\nMr. Benson: I want you to pull everything you can find on our clients' financial situation before the agreement with us, one month after signing and their current standing. \nMark: That's a lot of work. I don't know if that's doable in one day. \nMr. Benson: I'm sure you can manage. \nMark: And when do you need it?\nMr. Benson: Like Andy's presentation - by the end of the day.\nMr. Benson: Since everyone knows what to do, let's make it work!\n******************************************************************************************\n==== PROCESSING EXAMPLES CONSISTING OF : 1 FACTS ====\nPROCESSING :  Andy will prepare a presentation on the company byt the end of the day\nPROCESSING :  Mark will cancel his day off on Mr\nPROCESSING :  Mark will do data mining on client's financial situation\nPROCESSING :  Claudia will call out major clients to ask about their satisfaction and provide data by 10:30\nPROCESSING :  Benson's request\n==== PROCESSING EXAMPLES CONSISTING OF : 2 FACTS ====\nPROCESSING :  Mark will cancel his day off on Mr. Mark will do data mining on client's financial situation\nPROCESSING :  Mark will cancel his day off on Mr. Andy will prepare a presentation on the company byt the end of the day\nPROCESSING :  Benson's request.

You know I can stir him into the right direction, he could really make him think\\r\\nAnna: I don't know... He's only gonna get mad.\\r\\nLisa: At Sam?\\r\\nAnna: At me.\\r\\nLisa: Oh, I see. Maybe you should try to talk to him, but like serious for once, not just in regards to you know, some one thing he messed up, but his general attitude.\\r\\nAnna: I know I should, but I am just so tired all the time, I get mad and then I just let it go.\\r\\nLisa: What do you say we leave Stevie with your sister and go to a SPA for a day during the weekend? A nice massage and a facial? Could only do you good.\\r\\nAnna: That would be absolutely fantastic.\\r\\nLisa: I will call the Dream SPA later today. Cheer up.

What a brilliant idea :)\\r\\nAgnes: Cool :) Here are some gift inspirations, let me know what you think: <file_other>\\r\\nAgnes: <file_photo>\\r\\nJane: This first one is so sweet! OMG baby clothes are terrific!\\r\\nAlice: No offence, Agnes, but I think we should buy something more useful like a huge Pampers pack for example. I know that designer clothes are good quality and stuff but you know she won’t use them much and they will be too small in a blink of an eye anyway.\\r\\nAgnes: None taken, Alice. I just thought that diapers are kinda impersonal and she won’t even remember who she got them from.\\r\\nAlice: Sure, I get it. I just know that my baby shower gift turned out not to be very useful in a long term.\\r\\nKathy: Guys, how about some compromise? Both ideas are great so maybe we can buy a cheaper onesie, e.g. <file_other> and put it in a basket surrounded by diapers? Look: <file_photo>\\r\\nJane: Now that’s something worth considering.\\r\\nAlice: Win-win\\r\\nAgnes: I still think clothes are better, but we live in a world of democracy, so I won’t argue.\\r\\nKathy: Don’t be like this, Agnes…\\r\\nAgnes: Like what?\\r\\nAlice: A bitch?\\r\\nAgnes: EXCUSE ME? Did you just call me a B WORD?!?!?!?!\\r\\nJane: Oh boy\\r\\nAlice: Yes, I did. We want to do something special for our friend and you’re acting like a princess, so unless you stop to do so, I’m going to call you this :)\\r\\nAgnes: I won’t listen to this bullshit. Goodbye, Alice.\\r\\nJane: Did you just removed her from the conversation?\\r\\nKathy: Come on, Agnes, this was mean, but she just wants what’s best for Ursula.\\r\\nAgnes: You want to add something, Kathy?\\r\\nKathy: No, let’s move on.\n summary                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Agnes wants to throw a baby shower for Ursula and suggests designer clothes as a gift.

Probably will finish by midday and from then on nothing too urgent.\\r\\nMark: I don't know how to tell you this, but I was supposed to have the next day off so I planned to finish all urgent tasks tomorrow.\\r\\nMr. Benson: Mark, can you cancel the day off? We really need your help here.\\r\\nMark: That's not really that important. I just need to make a few phone calls. When will you be back, Mr. Benson?\\r\\nMr. Benson: On Tuesday.

I'll be right back. \\r\\nMr. Benson: All right. Claudia - Since you have the smallest workload I want you to call all out major clients and ask them about client satisfaction. Lona has the survey, so ask her for it. \\r\\nClaudia: Of course. \\r\\nMr. Benson: You don't have much time, because I'll need the processed data by 11.\\r\\nClaudia: You'll have it on your e-mail by 10:30.\\r\\nMark: I'm back.\\r\\nMr. Benson: Thank you, Claudia. Andy - I need you to prepare a presentation on our company. Something for laymen, not too complicated and not too specialised. A lot of positive figures.\\r\\nAndy: No problem, sir. Do you need any specific data?\\r\\nMr. Benson: Financial, social and something intangible. \\r\\nAndy: By when do you need it?\\r\\nMr. Benson: By the end of the day. \\r\\nAndy: Will do. \\r\\nMr. Benson: Thank you, Andy.
