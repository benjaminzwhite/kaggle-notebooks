During this process the acidity of the curd increases to a desired level. The curd is then milled into ribbon shaped pieces and salt is mixed into it to arrest acid development. The salted green cheese curd is put into cheese moulds lined with cheesecloths and pressed overnight to allow the curd particles to bind together. The pressed blocks of cheese are then removed from the cheese moulds and are either bound with muslin-like cloth, or waxed or vacuum packed in plastic bags to be stored for maturation. Vacuum packing removes oxygen and prevents mould (fungal) growth during maturation, which depending on the wanted final product may be a desirable characteristic or not.\\\\n\\\\nMould-ripening\\\\nMain article: Cheese ripening\\\\nIn contrast to cheddaring, making cheeses like Camembert requires a more gentle treatment of the curd.

As with many foods the presence of water and the bacteria in it encourages decomposition.

There are several ways to separate the curd from the whey.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMaturing cheese in a cheese cellar\\\\nScalding\\\\nIn making Cheddar (or many other hard cheeses) the curd is cut into small cubes and the temperature is raised to approximately 39 \\\\u00b0C (102 \\\\u00b0F) to 'scald' the curd particles.

Bacteria which produce only lactic acid during fermentation are homofermentative; those that also produce lactic acid and other compounds such as carbon dioxide, alcohol, aldehydes and ketones are heterofermentative. Fermentation using homofermentative bacteria is important in the production of cheeses such as Cheddar, where a clean, acid flavour is required.
